The Apurva Kempinski Bali,A Moment (Wedding) To Remember,10/01/2021,"This place is always so comfy and cozy. With its luxury interior and a touch of Balinese feel on the exterior, you will feel that you are in paradise. I had my wedding here in Apurva and kudos to the team. They are very professional, warm and I feel that I am in good hands. Shout out especially to Ros for always catering to our needs. I always have low expectation on Hotel food but the food they serve here exceeds my expectation. Very delicious indeed. As for the spa, it is so Zen and peaceful. Very relaxing and definitely took my mind off from the stressful life and took the fatigue away. Great place to just relax, or even have a great event in this amazing place. Definitely coming back for more :)"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Nice hotel but the service could be better,10/01/2021,"We stayed at Apurva Kempinski for 2 nights for our honeymoon. Room was good and clean. The hotel has a lot of instagramable spots. We tried dinner at Bai Yun restaurant (the food and the service were really good) & breakfast at reef restaurant. Unfortunately we feel the Covid-19 protocol during breakfast could be better, while they let the staffs help with taking your food they combine all the guests inside one restaurant without social distancing so it was pretty cramped. We also had problems with the service such as luggage delivery & room assistance being slow and the showerhead in our room fell off, but the manager Steffi already managed & assisted us in solving our problems so we're left pretty satisfied with how the problems were handled."
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,The Wedding,10/01/2021,"The Best Service from Ms. Deviana Ros n Ms. Elsa Sangat bertanggung jawab terhadap kita dan cepat tanggap dlm handle kita. Very Good lah to Ms. Deviana Ros, semua urusan beliau cepat handle, berpengalaman🙏"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Sangat menyenangkan,10/01/2021,"Kamarnya bagus dan bersih Staff hotel ramah dan sangat membantu. Tidak ribet. Peraturan hotel tidak kaku jd bikin nyaman. Luas bangettttt 14 hektar. Karna luas lift nya jd agak bingungin awal nya tapi hari berikutnya ud hafal. Kalau buat yg suka stay di hotel ga mau kemana2 pasti ngerasain nyaman banget banyak tempat hotel yg di explore. Tapi kalau yg suka jalan2 keluar, hotel cuman buat tidur saja kurang cocok karna lokasi agak jauh dari Kuta Seminyak."
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Great hotel with superb facilities,09/01/2021,"We booked both suite and deluxe room. Both rooms were well maintained. Beware, the hotel area is very big. Be prepared to walk a lot to get around the hotel. They provide buggy tho. The staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful too. Kids playground is great. We asked for baby crib and they provided some basic amenities for baby too. It will be one of our preferred hotel to stay in Bali and would definitely recommend it to others too"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,wonderful experience,10/01/2021,"I had a wonderful experience here. Every staff member I encountered were delightful and eager to help. The sevice was exceptional as well. Looking forward to my next stay, will recommend to friends as well."
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Excellent Service,10/01/2021,"Dari awal masuk, proses check in, menunggu jam check in sampai pengantaran ke room pelayannannya super baik dan ramah. Sambil dijelaskan banyak fasitilas yang digunakan. Fasilitas cukup banyak, makanan enak, kamar luass.. Will soon back here again."
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Nice hotel,10/01/2021,"This is my second stay in this hotel, first time was 2 years ago with my family. This time I came with my husband and we tries the cliff private pool ocean suite. I am a little disappointed with the room, I got the one on 11th floor and the room is next to the alley of the lift, so everybody going to and from the lift can see the room, especially the pool and the bathup very clear. Even there’s one time a security guard walk pass by and wave at me while I’m in the pool. I think there’s no privacy at all, and the bathup with the ocean view is a waste because we cannot open the curtain. However, everything else about this hotel is very nice. The hotel staff are all very polite, nice, and friendly. You should try the restaurant especially Bai Yun and Izakaya, the food is very…"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Good experince,10/01/2021,"This is the best villa lounge ever, amazing atmosphere, good food and cleanliness, staffs also so explainable any information and thank you to the staff mbak Fitri to helpful us. We will back soon!!!!"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,A better experience than before,09/01/2021,"This is our 3rd visit in a year. And the last one is the better experience than before. All staffs are so helpfull and always greeted us when we passed by. Please send my regards to Mr. Irawan in Front Desk for helping me get the best view room (I think the hotel reaches 60% Occupancy and I requested it when I'm checking in, btw). He also noticed that i have a son and send a little gift to him. In our stay, we also have a dinner in Bai Yun (Chinese) Restaurant. I think this is the best Hot Pot restaurant in Bali right now. Definitely will be back again :) If you are looking for a famliy friendly hotel, The Apurva Kempinski Bali should be in the top of the list. Thank you apurva kempinski bali!"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,SPECTACULAR,10/01/2021,"When we arrived at the resort, our car could not enter the building because a government event was being held that day. Our car had to circle for about 15 minutes. In the end, many guests were forced to walk from the parking lot to the lobby. We stayed for two nights in Cliff Private Pool Ocean View room and couldn’t ask for a better experience for real. The amenities, the bed, and the view are excellent. The sunrise view from our room is spectacular. All other facilities that they provide in the resort make you never bored during the stay I want to express my gratitude to Mr. Arya Wirawan, the Cliff lounge manager, who has accommodated our complaints during the check-in process. His professionalism, empathy, and hospitality make our stay even more memorable in The Apurva…"

The Apurva Kempinski Bali,The Worst Resort Service in Bali,10/01/2021,"DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL UNLESS YOU LIKE TO BE TREATED INHUMANLY!! Talked to my relatives and friends, who stayed in this hotel before, about my bad experience, they ALL came across a similar experience as mine! This is my second visit. My first visit was 3 months ago and the experience was horrible. Since my son likes their water slides, we decided to give this hotel a second chance. No surprise, this hotel ruined our holiday AGAIN. I did write a review to the hotel after my first stay but received no response nor improvement. Clearly, they ignored guests comments. Let me LIST what I had been through during these two stays (total 7 nights): 1. Four of us stayed in a Jr cliff ocean suite with extra bed and one child breakfast had been paid in advance. WHENEVER we go to the…"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Probably the best hotel and resort in Bali.,10/01/2021,"We stayed here for 4 days. We moved from front ocean to Sanghari villa. It is very nice villa and to be honest probably the best in Bali. We are back here after 2 years without travelling. It is a payback time :) + Clean room, friendly staff, big bed, nice view, nice breakfast ( lots of selection ), - Difficult finding parking especially when no driver."
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Our second stay,09/01/2021,"Our second visit to this hotel, this time we were a couple celebrating our honeymoon. Before we stay, Ms. Armini from Reservation Team very helpful to arranged our room and also arranged my family room. Checked in was smooth with Ms. Diana assistance & also checked out was great with Mr. Deni assistance. We had lunch at The Reef Beach Club and we had our dinner at Izakaya by Oku. The staff are amazing and very friendly. Shout out to Ms. Devi at Izakaya bu Oku who assisted us during our dinner time with complimentary honeymoon cake & ice cream. During breakfast at Pala Restaurant, Mr. Hariasa, Ms. Sariani, dan Mr. Ngurah were very helpful. We were always very satisfied for everything in Apurva Kempinski Bali! its attentive service, its delicious and wide spread food, and its…"

The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Perfect Staycation,09/01/2021,"We have just spent our 2nd nights out of our planned 4-nights here. So far evrything are flawless and we were impressed since our arrival and being picked up at the airport. My wife (a Gold Discovery Kempinski Member) and I picked the Ocean Cliff Junior Suite with private pool. Check-in process was smoothly done helped by Demi(?) at the lounge. The premises area is huge with beach front. Room is spacious with contemporary design of dark woods touch. Amenities are abundant. Suite guesses are given complimentary breakfast at the Cliff Lounge which we love the selection both ala carte and buffet menus. In room dining meals also suits to our taste and portion referrence. The staff are pleasantly and genuinely attentive, and some of them remembered my wife names and our…"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,what an experience !,09/01/2021,"We have such a gladly wonderful experience stayin at this resort! a very thoughtful resort with a magnificent concept of Majapahit Kingdom make us felt like a true guest of the kingdom. The building, the facilities, the services and the staff are exceptional! Not to mention a bad experience I had when I lost my access card after playing at the beach, the front desk staff, Mr Irawan and Miss Tami (not really remember the name but really want to give a credit to her as she is also very lovely) are so very helpful with the process of us getting a new access card without hesitation. For overall experiences I would love to give all staffs and facilities 100000000 out of 10!"

Wij komen zeker nog een keer terug!"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Best View Hotel in Nusa Dua Bali and Romantic Koral Restaurant,09/01/2021,"Yeay! I'm so happy finally visited one of the grandest hotels in Nusa Dua Bali. I want to tell about my experience when I entered Apurva Kempinski Bali. They have underwater hidden gems with natural and romantic vibes. This hotel is strategic location quite close to the airport only about 30 minutes, if you use a car via the toll road. When heading to the hotel, we will enter Jl. Raya Nusa Dua Selatan, Benoa, Kuta Selatan, Badung this are which is very beautiful, the setting is suitable for those who like the natural atmosphere. Arriving at the Apurva Kempinski Bali Gate Hotel, we were greeted by very friendly staff, the lobby was magnificent architecture and the view was really amazing cool because its directly faced the sea and we could also see the swimming pool from above…"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Outstanding service !,09/01/2021,"Trust is earn not given, it is truly what we’ve experienced during our stay in Apurva for the past 4 days. The service was right away spot on during the check in process for our Junior Cliff Suite, the front office officer - Setyawan was an outstanding hotelier ! He truly shown a great hospitality during the check in process and ensuring that my family needs and requirement are taken care of during our stay. We experienced an unfortunate situation where my wife left her mobile phone in the room upon check out and we just realized it several hours upon our departure. The service center staff - Ayu Sudarmi handled our call to ask for the missing mobile phone situation calmly and in proper manner, within minutes the hotel staff confirming that the mobile phone was indeed left in…"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,"11/10. Amazing, personalised service. Great attention to detail, hygiene & safety during COVID.",09/01/2021,"I am a frequent visitor of Bali - allured by it's mystical and magical aura as well as the variety of activities suited for any type of traveler. Most of all, I love the warmth and friendliness of the Balinese & Indonesian people. No more is this more apparent than in The Apurva Kempinski Hotel - which combines a breathtaking property with surreal views, world class facilities and arguably the best hospitality I have ever experienced. Any hotel can take your breath away, especially in Bali where you have a long menu of exceptional properties to choose from - but it's the little things that matters and the service which, for me, puts Apurva in a league of their own. I'll give some examples. My wife drinks a lot of water, housekeeping picked up on this without us informing them…"

The Apurva Kempinski Bali,MEMORABLE HONEYMOON STAY,08/01/2021,"We booked The Apurva Kempinski Bali for our honeymoon and came with a very high expectation. Honestly, the experience was beyond what we had expected. First off we were greeted with a happy-honeymoon flower arrangement, cake, fruit, and champagne. (interestingly they provide us herbs for our honeymoon, namely “Jamu Kuat for me and Sari Rapet for her”) lol. Amazing landscape, luxurious room, and amenities, topped with impeccable and extra personal service (most of the staff members greet you by name!). Special thanks to Ibu Ririn Sidabutar for arranged my room started from pre-arrival, thank you to Pak Arya for providing good service in operations, thank you to Wanda Adi for giving us very friendly service with whatever our needs are.

Hilton Bali Resort,Nice place to stay!,10/01/2021,"The hospitality are really great! Never had experienced such a great hospitality and nice staffs. I like the cleanness and ambience, also the view was pretty too! Served breakfast so well and foods are tasty tok! Will be back to hilton if i visit Bali again"
Hilton Bali Resort,No redeeming quality but the view.,10/01/2021,"Honestly appalling. Every single thing about the resort was horrible, the only saving grace is the view. First impression: the lady who checked us in seemed really inexperienced/undertrained. we had booked a room with executive lounge access, and she didn’t mentioned anything about it. Until we asked, which turned out the lounge was closed and we were only given 2 drinks voucher for the evening. Very disappointing, as if compared to ANY other hotel/resorts, an executive lounge will have full access all day for non-alcoholic drinks, and some food in certain time of day. When we asked if any food will be served along with the drinks, she said no and only drinks are offered. She did slip that they were “cutting down” which I assumed due to the pandemic therefore I let it go. When…"
Hilton Bali Resort,Clean rooms yummy breakfast,10/01/2021,"Clean rooms, lots of food for breakfast, large resort hotel. Comfortable sofa bed area, expensive small portion gado2. Welcoming staff but did not get welcome drink maybe cz i checkedin for a wedding. Lunch food was average. Had to walk to the security pos to pickup gofood as usual with large hotels -inconvenient but what can we do.."
Hilton Bali Resort,Clean and friendly staff,10/01/2021,"Beautiful view, good location, very friendly and responsive staffs. A bit far to walk from parking lot to the lobby. However it is very recommended to stay here of you want to have a good and quality time with your family."
Hilton Bali Resort,Honeymoon in Bali,10/01/2021,Menginaplah di hotel bintang 5 di Bali salah satunya hilton bali resort. fasilitas mewah dan memiliki akses langsung ke pantai. saya memilih kamar tipe cliff tower ocean view. sangat indah bisa menikmati lautan lepas dari balkon kamar.
Hilton Bali Resort,Staff Training Lacking,08/01/2021,"Its very out of keeping for me to write a review that is less than glowing. After contacting their management and getting such a poor response, I felt the need to sadly. Let me start out with the positives: The 1 bedroom executive suites are fantastic - so well appointed, huge decks, amazing views - superb. The pool with the slides for the kids are fantastic The downside: Check in takes on average 1 hour every time we stayed which was 3 times over this past year. The food is terrible. The beach (unlike other hotels in Nusa Dua) isn't safe for swimming, is very steep and you can't do any Watersports or activities like cycling along the beach like other hotels which is a big disadvantage. Perhaps the biggest issue however is the staff training. During the pandemic, we…"
Hilton Bali Resort,Honeymoon in Bali 💕❤️,10/01/2021,"Menginap di Hotel bintang 5 kawasan Nusa Dua - Hilton Bali Resort merupakan pilihan yang tepat saat liburan di Bali. Sambil menunggu sunset kita bisa duduk santai dan menikmati makanan dan minuman di The Shore Restaurant. Hotelnya bersih, pemandangannya bagus dan staff hotel ramah. Fasilitas di hotel ini super lengkap dan mewah mulai dari kolam renang , gym, pantai, restoran dll. Menu breakfast ya juga beraneka ragam dan rasanya enak banget. Saya dan suami memilih kamar dg tipe cliff tower ocean view. Wajib banget deh saat anda berkunjung ke Bali menginaplah di Hilton Bali Resort Guys. 😉😀☺️"
Hilton Bali Resort,first time,10/01/2021,"hotel dengan harga sangat terjangkau di masa pandemi. menawarkan free up grade kamar ke kelas yang lebih tinggi. kamar luas, sangat terawat. sprei, bed cover, handuk, semua putih bersih tanpa noda secuilpun. akses langsung ke pantai dari belakang hotel, hanya pantainya kurang cocok untuk berenang. ada observation deck di cliff tower yang pemandangannya luar biasa saat malam. yang kurang dari hotel ini, internetnya putus nyambung, parkir jauh dan sandal hotel by request."
Hilton Bali Resort,절대 추천 안합니다.,09/01/2021,"일단 직원들 한테 요청하면 소통이 안되서 똑같은 내용을 3~4번씩 설명해야 하고, 방음이 진짜 최악으로 안됩니다. 특히 다른방에서 샤워 하거나 욕조에 물 받으면 무슨 천둥소리 처럼 엄청크고 방에서 조그맣게 떠드는 소리까지 다 들려서 3일 내내 잠을 설쳤습니다. 그리고 음식은 너무 맛이 없으며(여행가면 로컬 음식도 다 잘 먹는 1인), 저와 남편둘다 음식에서 머리카락 나왔습니다. 호텔 음식을 남기기는 첨이였네요. 그리고 아고다로는 절대 예약 하지 마세여. 2명 정보가 항상 저장 되어있었는데 무슨 아고다에서 만든 스페셜가격으로 예약 했다가 정보가 1명으로 바뀌면서 조식등 힐튼 체크인시 추가 요금을 냈으며, 아고다로 요청했던 높은층, 허니문등등 요청 사항 선택이 있는데 하나도 힐튼에 전달 되지 않는다고 합니다. 그리도 좋아서 혹시 힐튼 하실경우 아고다로는 하지 마세요."
Hilton Bali Resort,Beautiful property but lack of personal service,09/01/2021,"Im here for my honeymoon, so my expectation is a bit higher than the usual. The property is beautiful and clean. However there is no valet service to help with the parking. Little thing such as ice cube is charged. Payment at the restaurant has to be in front, so I don’t feel like it’s the usual resort’s service."
Hilton Bali Resort,Nice Hotel with blue ocean,09/01/2021,"I love this hotel, staffs are friendly, food was great, room view is excellent. You also can find monkey around the hotel. This hotel has a nice beach sand, also an outdoor jacuzzi. Super love and recommended!"
Hilton Bali Resort,"Amazing stay experience, never failed",09/01/2021,"3rd times coming and always amazing. This time i got upgraded to the one bedroom villa. All the staff are very helpful especially Pak Agus as a Front Office Manager was making our check in process ran smoothly. See you for the next bali visit, Hilton Bali Resort 😊"
Hilton Bali Resort,A Hilton experience,09/01/2021,"I wouldn’t say that I didn’t enjoy my stay here but couple of things need to be said: + I love the breakfast selection and also eggs station definitely my top picks + Although I didn’t go to swim here, the pool is really beautiful, spacious and kids-friendly - Lifts took forever and they only turned one or two lifts so it took quite some time - not a big fan of monkeys, there are quite a lot of monkeys and we need to keep the door closed - super slow internet connection and might not be suitable for video conferences. I rarely used it and ended up tethered from my mobile"
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,Family Vacation on Uluwatu Cliff. Worth it to try!,10/01/2021,"Anantara Uluwatu is worth it to stay with family! Ocean view experience from the villa is amazing, also their 5 stars service. But cause of pandemic shutdown effect, lot of things still need detail maintenance. I hope this 5 stars hotel and all-Bali Tourism recovery soon! Oiya, you must see the sunset! Anantara have the best view I ever seen!"
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,Better stay at other hotel,09/01/2021,"We reached the hotel quite late due to some accident happened on our way there. We were quickly greeted by a very knowledgeable front desk officer. He explained everything very detailed. We booked 2 rooms and stayed for 3d2n. Hotel gave complimentary photo sessions for both rooms. Unfortunately since it is quite late, photo sessions were fully booked on the following day so our photo sessions were scheduled on the check out day. The only slot available was at 1pm and we were told that the photo result would only be available at 3pm. Because of that, we asked for late check out. The front desk informed us that they can only provide late check out at 3pm for one room which was fine with us. Then I asked the front desk to ensure that when we checked out at 3pm, the photo result…"
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,Great Resort and Service,10/01/2021,"Visited this amazing resort for a day and it was such an amazing experience. The 2 bedroom villas are super clean, the the staffs are kind and helpful. We also have our own small garden, pool, and living room, which is very convenient for a family. However, the stairs are unbelievable. Maybe it’s better to have a lift from the parking lot to the lobby. Despite of that, we will definitely come back again for another great stay."
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,Amazing experience at anantara uluwatu,10/01/2021,The room is spacious and clean..breakfast various and also delicious..view so nice and pool so big..hospitality no 1! Very recommended to stay here..i get photo session with my family..we create memories here..thank you anantara 😁
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,"Breathtaking ocean view from your suite, but noisy",09/01/2021,"We stayed at ocean view suite. Beautiful view and no obstruction view of the sunset. Small fishing boats in the horizon and surfers riding the small waves. You can also decent to the beach below with the elevator, operating in limited time in the afternoon during low tide. The jacuzzi on the balcony is a plus. The most downside is the suite is not sound proof at all. Can hear clearly the noises coming from the sound system in the next room, so annoying. We complained but only stop for a while. The suites boast with Bose sound system but room is not sound proof. And the noises from the suites below were also apparent. Breakfast at 360 is good especially the Western menu. The others restaurants : Sono Japanese Teppanyaki and Blue Bottle is just OK.. Waiters and staffs…"
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,5 x Star Service Level ( Staff Fantastic),09/01/2021,Fantastic Level of Service from Front Desk and Back Office Staff. 5 Stars. Especially Kadek Budiartha and Fafa. Thank you again. Looking forward to coming back soon with my family. ( By the way..if you surf or like watching ocean..Impossibles is right out front. Spectacular views of Bukit Peninsula.
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,A very pleasant relax hotel in Uluwatu,08/01/2021,"A cliffside, exclusive hotel in coastline of Uluwatu with serene atmosphere, amazing views to the ocean and spacious rooms fit for family or couple staycations. Hotel is most suitable for a laid-back, slow-paced and quiet retreat-like experience. I'd recommend at least spending two full days at the hotel to enjoy everything the hotel has to offer, as there are lots to see and do and it'd be the best way to get the most value out of the hotel. Rooms are also very comfortable and spacious, complete with very comfortable beddings as well. It is definitely a good idea to enjoy them as long as you can while you stay here. I won't recommend staying here if you're planning to go outside and about for most of the day because you'll be missing out on much that way."
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,最悪のホテル,08/01/2021,昨年ここのホテルのvoucherを購入しました。2021年末迄の使用期限ですが、このコロナ禍で海外旅行に行けません。 日本だけでなくバリ島でも観光客の受け入れをしていません。どう考えてもバリにいくすべがないんです。なので voucherの使用期限延長について問い合わせをしたところ、はじめは延長はないと言う返答、それはないのではと再交渉したら来年7.8月以外でさらに4泊につき600ドル追加を払うなら考えると回答。納得がいかないので返金をして欲しいと交渉しましたが断られました。バニヤンツリーで同じくvoucherを購入しましたがバニヤンツリーはホテルから予約期限延長の連絡がきました。一流ホテルと一流ぶっているホテルの差なのか？海外旅行に行けない今、海外旅行を夢見て宿泊券を購入しているのに誠意ない対応に悲しくなりました。
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,Amazing ocean view from the room.,08/01/2021,They have amazing view and access to the beach. You can see sunset from your room. The room was still clean and well maintain during the pandemic. Friendly and helpfull staff. They gave me surprised birthdaycake. Thank you so much.
Double-Six Luxury Hotel Seminyak,Luxury Hotel in Seminyak,10/01/2021,"One pf the best luxury hotel in Seminyak area.

Would love to spend more days and definetely will comeback again to this beautiful hotel with Miami vibes"
Double-Six Luxury Hotel Seminyak,Lovely Hotel in Seminyak,10/01/2021,"It’s our second stay here, but now with the kids and parents. Everything is still lovely like it was. We stayed in penthouse which has 2 bedroom and spacious living room with rooftop jacuzzi, beautiful! Breakfast menus become more Indonesian, totally understood as we have mostly domestic travellers, taste good tho. Service is very professional as always. Highly recommend this hotel for those who’d like to explore Seminyak area."

Golden Tulip Jineng Resort,Good FAMILY HOTEL,10/01/2021,"Staying 3N here, good hotel, good open space and pool, luxurious, however this is very suitable for family, since there's lot of kids in the pool area. The breakfast is quite basic, and the room if still find some spot that not clean enough, when I arrived i need to call the housekeeping 2 times to make the room cleaner. The hotel also seems to reduce the cost, since in 3 nights I've stayed they never changed the hand sanitizer in the lift, so it always empty. But it's really recommended if you have family with kids to stay here"
Natya Resort Ubud,Beautiful forest view from the bedroom. True Ubud vibes.,08/01/2021,"We absolutely loved our stay at Natya, especially given how beautiful of a view you have from the bedroom overlooking the lush forest jungle. The bathtub was nice (and had enough hot water thankfully!) and it was beautiful to have a downstairs area to hang around by the pool. Didn’t use the private pool at all, as it was just a plunge pool, but it was a beautiful venue that was so serene, quiet, and enveloped in nature. The pool for all guests is stunning and overlooks into the forest as well, so I’ll have to come back to use it!"

Но самое ужасное то, что телефон телефона, который лежал на тумбочке в нескольких сантиметрах от кровати бы погрызан! То есть крыса забралась на тумбочку и сидела в прямо возле моего лица, отделяемого лишь балдахином! Мы переночевали в другой комнате, а на следующее утро пришли собирать вещи и выселяться из отеля.

Lv8 Resort Hotel,Sangat tidak recommended,09/01/2021,"Hari pertama datang di suruh menunggu 2 jam buat check in, ok lah demi kamar yg nyaman. Ternyata sangat di luar ekspektasi, air panas rusak, handuk mandi lebih cocok buat jd handuk lantai, amenities sangat tidak lengkap( tidak ada baju kimono, sendal, gelas hanya 1 ) , bantal nya bau seperti bekas di pakai, apalagi sofa yg sangat bau seperti tidak pernah di cuci. Shower closet berada di sebelah kiri spt org kidal,tidak ada welcome drink, kurangnya customer satisfaction , ranjang twin yg terlalu sempit. Saat menceritakan komplain dengan salah satu staf yg mengantar jawaban nya “ kita sedang PENGIRITAN “ what an answered 😑 “ Sangat tidak recomended, bahkan hotel yg jauh lebih murah pelayanan dan fasilitas nya jauh lbh baik. Tidak akan pernah kembali ke sini."

The Haven Bali,Poor condition and breakfast,10/01/2021,"It's 3 years since I last stayed in the Haven, my recollection was then it was a clean property well located near Jl double six and fairly priced. Unfortunately since that time the condition of the rooms has noticeably deteriorated. For our 2 night stay the premium room condition was shabby. The evening we arrived we noticed mosquitoes in the room so asked for the room to be sprayed, this was done promptly by housekeeping however when we returned from dinner 2 hrs later, while the mosquitoes were gone we found 5 large dead cockroaches on the floor. Next morning the standard and the quality of the breakfast it was clear had also gone down so much so that despite the room rate including breakfast we ate breakfast at another hotel on the second morning before leaving.

Mathis Lodge Amed,A perfect place for some mountain peace :),10/01/2021,Absolutely perfect place for coming with a partner. It's at the top of a mountain just a few minutes from Amed...though you'll probably want to spend all of your time here ;) Every detail in the rooms is beautifully designed and all of the small comforts are there that make you feel right at home. They have a nice communal / restaurant / pool area as well that is super comfortable where you could spend time if you don't get the private pool / jacuzzi rooms. They also have a shuttle up the 15 minute dirt road that I'd suggest taking especially if you're 2 people on a moto. Definitely will be back!
Mathis Lodge Amed,Dreamy.. the perfect venue,10/01/2021,"I visited with my partner last weekend and had the dreamiest stay. Everything about this venue has been beautiful done, with attention to detail in every fixture and item throughout the villas and restaurant. We stayed in the jacuzzi villa and enjoyed coffee with the most perfect views of mountains & ocean. I can’t recommend this place enough & hope to return soon. Definitely my favourite venue in Bali. Arrive early & don’t plan to leave until you have too.. because you will want to stay longer! Top tip.. the road up the hill is long & a dirt road, so take everything you need with you and plan to stay until you check out. They run a shuttle.. take the shuttle 🙏🤍"
Mathis Lodge Amed,Beautiful Place With Stunning Views,09/01/2021,"I went her with my girlfriend for her birthday and it did not disappoint! Its a beautiful resort with an African Safari Lodge theme, but with Balinese influences also! The manager Frédéric was very helpful with arranging everything and was very hospitable during our stay! The view is absolutely stunning from where the resort is located, on a mountainside, a little outside of Amed. The rooms and the public areas within the resort are beautifully designed and all of the staff were helpful and friendly. The food and drinks were satisfactory, and of a reasonable price, for this type of resort. I would thoroughly recommend staying in such a beautifully designed and unique place!"
Mathis Lodge Amed,Epoustouflant !,09/01/2021,"il y a des endroits qui comme ça si vous avez la chance d'y être, vous permettent de réaliser à quel point Bali est magique. On se sent hors du monde et on contemple dans une sérénité absolue la vue féérique qui s'offre à nous comme un cadeau des cieux. Passé l'aventure amusante de la montée vers le Mathis Lodge en pickup avec Kadek, on se retrouve dans un endroit assez irréel ou les yeux ne savent plus ou donner. L'accueil de Frédéric dés que l'on arrive au sommet vous fait penser que vous allez passer un séjour spécial, et ça le fait. Le lobby et la piscine donnant une vue féérique sur la baie est simplement magnifique et quand on découvre la suite, on a plus vraiment de mots. Tout est dans le détail et savoir qu'on ne va y passer que 2 nuits seulement devient une…"

Mathis Lodge Amed,Отель в горном ущелье,08/01/2021,"Мне очень понравилось нахождение в этом отеле. Он уникален - и местоположением, и интерьером. Сюда доехать можно только на трансфере, т.к. дорога очень плохая. Но зато отель расположен в ущелье, между потрясающе красивых горных хребтов, с видом на океан. Всего в отеле 20 бунгало, все они сделаны из натуральных материалов, чтобы гармонично вписываться в ландшафт. Много дерева и камня, пальмовых листьев, канатов, каждая деталь интерьера продумана. Правда на территории нет никаких развлечений, только бассейн, дорогой ресторан и спа. Но сюда нужно ехать на перезагрузку. Если вы хотите побыть наедине с природой, почувствовать ее запахи, послушать звуки, погулять по затерянным горным тропам - вам сюда. Отдельное спасибо менеджеру отеля, очень вежливый человек, профессионал, все…"

Best sleep I’ve had In years! When you’re done pondering life over the beautiful Amed mountains, you can head over the the gorgeous pool area and enjoy their generous food portions. If you are staying longer there are so many activities nearby line scuba and snorkelling or just hanging out by the ocean. The resort provides a shuttle service to and from the beach area an all staff is very helpful. You’ll love the interior of the place and integration with nature around. Jacuzzi was the best one I’ve ever used - an amazing treat when the sun goes down !"

Breakfast is served ala carte and we can choose whether we want them to be served to our room or dine in at their restaurant. We had an Indonesian and western-style breakfast along with a bread basket, fruit platters, tea, and milk for our daughter. My daughter really enjoys her day at the kids club. It has a colorful design with cute cloud shapes.…"
Kanvaz Village Resort Seminyak,Absolutely stunning hotel!!,10/01/2021,"Its a great art hotel with luxurious design, it was famous with the pattiserrie..

Kanvaz Village Resort Seminyak,"One of the most ""worth it"" hotel!",10/01/2021,"With their location, room, and service, this hotel is definitely worth every penny. I came back to this hotel recently after staying almost 8 nights back in June 2021. They definitely have improved. I can see breakfast is already buffet and they improved the amenities inside the room :) Room is as comfy as it used too, and service is just top notch. With the newly established patisseries right in front of the hotel, more reason to stay in this hotel! If you were like me, having a limited time in Bali, then this hotel is for you, no doubt! Most of the hyped places in Bali is within 10 minutes walk from this hotel. Revolver, Expat, Pison, Monsieur Spoon, Bodywork spa, Si Jin, Woobar, seasalt, Biku, and this list can go on."

Kanvaz Village Resort Seminyak,"Beauty in a ""Kanvaz""",08/01/2021,"Stayed here to celebrate our anniversary. It was a wonderful stay, especially for our toddler daughter who enjoyed the pool so much, which can be accessed directly from our room. We enjoyed the quietness so much during the pandemic (in a good way), not to mention almost every spot is a nice instagram spot (try the rooftop during the sunset). Love the design so much, it really describes the beauty in a ""Kanvaz"". I would highlight the staff's friendliness, especially Eka who was so playful to our daughter. Last but not least, we really enjoyed the super delicious special ""Anniversary"" greetings, which was one of the special menus from the Pastisseries. Will definitely come back."

Grand Hyatt Bali,Love everything about this resort,10/01/2021,"Stayed here with 2 friends, they upgraded our room to a suite. Love the spacious bathroom with a big tub, 2 showers, and 2 toilets. We had a pond in our backyard. I personally love the breakfast the most, especially the pancake/waffle station. Ibu Dewi was really kind and helpful—all the staffs are angels though. And I love how they employed older people. If there’s anything to improve, I’d suggest fixing the concierge web chat. I don’t think it’s working."

Grand Hyatt Bali,Perfect hotel to stay,10/01/2021,"Overall, I am highly satisfied with the service provided by Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua and I am looking forward to stay there again. Staffs are very friendly, kind and helpful. The best thing is, during this covid 19 pandemic, they provide the private clinic located down the lobby to do the antigen test and it is very helpful for the one who wants to fly with a plane because we are required to do antigen at least 1 x 24 hours before the flight. Also, the breakfast was delicious as expected, the room service was fabulous (my wife and I ordered burger and nasi goreng). In addition, the pool was amazing but unfortunately I didn’t have a chance to swim there because I only spent 3 days in Bali :( hopefully I’ll be able to stay longer in grand hyatt nusa dua and try the fabulous swimming…"

Kamar sangat bagus dan cocok untuk saya bekerja work from Bali juga. Istri saya sangat menikmat jalan2 area hotel dan pantai. Hanya saja waktu itu ketika main air di area pantai, ada bendera merah, jadi sedikit ada ubur2 kecil yang agak gatal. Tapi overall saya suka pantainya. Suka dengan ke ramahan semua orang dari pintu masuk sampai batas pantai. Salut! Love this! Hanya saja tidak sempat mencoba kolamnya karena katanya lg renovasi. Padahal salah satu kolam terbesar. Sarapannya sangat enak!"
Grand Hyatt Bali,Stunning!!,08/01/2021,"It was an easy decision for us to go back to Grand Hyatt Bali, we have stayed there numerous times and have always had an amazing time. It's definitely a family-friendly resort, where the kids can go out to play in the pool or beach, and the parent can just sit back and relax. The staff are very friendly and treat everyone with gentle care. I do want to give a shout out to Ms. Fenny, who have always been very helpful to me. Whether it was for a business trip or family vacation, she always help me and make sure to check on me, whether its a ""hi how are you"" or "" can I help you with anything else"", it really does makes a huge different to my overall experience. Thank you Hyatt!!"

Could walk along the entire nusa dua beach Breakfast was really good. Healthy freshly squeezed fruits and vegetables juice. They were all delicious and sufficient varieties. We love that they have daily breakfast along with their classic ones. Really delicious! Would be better if some of the activities such as bicycles riding can be freely used by the guests. Think the guests need to pay hourly basis. Definitely recommended and would return!"

Grand Hyatt Bali,Stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua,08/01/2021,We chose Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua because we had stayed there many times in the past. We had not been there for a while but found this time the place was still terrific. Staff provided outstanding service during a period of heightened covid exposure in Indonesia. Staff was wonderful and made it a highly enjoyable stay. We would certainly recommend it to anyone.
Grandmas Plus Hotel Airport,Best transit hotel close to the Ngurah Rai Airport,10/01/2021,"We stayed two nights in transit at this hotel during Covid-19 lockdown. Considering the pandemic that is raging at the moment, Bali tourism got hit the most. However, it was very uplifting to see the spirit of the hotel especially the staff in providing the best service value to the guest. The staff are the jewels of the property. Their smiles and graciousness were exemplary. I would like to especially mention Dhamma, Aussie, Komang, Kariati and Era as well as the night security staff whom I did not quite get the name. He was not only on guard as security but helped us with luggages as we arrived already late in the evening and he was the only one available. Well done...."

The rooms and facilities are very complete and sufficient. The location is very close to the airport, so there is no need to rush to get to the airport. I was also helped to print out the PCR test description by the receptionist so I wasn't confused about where to print it. I really appreciate drinking water filled in refill bottles so it doesn't throw away a lot of plastic waste. Thank you Grandmas Hotel."

Grandmas Plus Hotel Airport,Comfortable stay. Value for your money!,08/01/2021,"Value for your money! The room is quite spacious and has complete amenities including a ready-to-use hairdryer! That's a bit rare to see in a 3 stars hotel nowadays. I love that the room is on the minimalistic side while still boasts plenty of features. The bed and the pillows are quite comfortable and although the mattress is a bit too soft to my liking, I still woke up refreshed. The one thing I like the most about the room was the two small windows that actually opens to let fresh air in. They have a small swimming pool on the ground floor but I didn't have the chance to try it. All in all, with all of those smiley faces and friendliness of the staff I highly recommend this hotel for the budget-conscious travellers who are looking for something that is low price yet offers a…"

The manager apologized and told us there's issues with the door that they need to fix. The manager gave us other room for us to freshen up while they prepare my actual room (which has been upgraded). Manager also gave us complimentary dinner to apologize so that's a good customer service. We went to dinner and when we're back, our actual room is ready. The rest is history!

Alila Seminyak,Nice oldie goldie property but questioning the readiness of the staffs to accept guest,10/01/2021,"Stayed one night before going back home. When arrived, noone, literally noone is there in the front area when your car is arrived at. Walked into the desk of reception, 3 young gentlemen were so busy looking at the screen in front of them, and not aware us arriving. I need to greet them first. Gave us an impression of: not ready to serve any guest? same with on the right side, 1 guy busy looking at screen. For us, first impression of the people serving is very important for the stay experience. The way those young gentlemen dressed are also not really up to the class. One with sleeves up, another one is down. Are Alila seminyak ready to serve professionally? I Only know during the day that the middle age lady is very accomodating and serving. And noone else like her. Passing…"
Alila Seminyak,They Serve With Heart!!,09/01/2021,"We stayed in Alila Seminyak for a night before going back to Jakarta. We had an amazing stay here, too bad that it was only for a night. I really love the simple interior they have, their cleanliness, their location, their view of the beach, their amenities (Not only smells great, but also I really really appreciate them for using the eco friendly packaging), oh and their pool too! They have 3 pools and if you're looking for the less crowded pool you can choose the ones on the L floor instead of the one next by the Beach Bar. Because in pandemic time, of course we are being extra careful for the hygiene, and this hotel meets our expectation. They also have a spacious gym, and a studio too. Would love to try the studio for dance practice or barre but sadly had no time. Asides…"

Alila Seminyak,Best in Seminyak,08/01/2021,It meets the expectations as I am a person with OCD. I intended to spot flaws on the corners and on areas that most people dont see. I even open the drainage in the bathtub to check if they cleaned it.

Mercure Bali Legian,"Not perfect, but decent.",10/01/2021,"Stayed here for 5 nights and I had a nice experience. 1. Check-in process I actually arrived a few hours earlier from the check-in hours but my room was ready, probably because there weren't many guests staying at that time. My ALL benefit was easily recognized and fulfilled. Surprisingly I got complimentary of fresh slice fruits which is perfect for hot weather in Bali. 2. Room I was staying in Room 106, and the room is pretty standard with other Mercure branded hotel. Almost squeaky clean but the glass table already shown wear and tear. Size is decent for solo/couple, however for parents who travels with kids, you might want to consider a bigger room. I was expecting my room to be located in the high floor per my usual preference, but it's not a big deal, turns out the room…"
Mercure Bali Legian,Very limited voucher tu be used for Accor Member,08/01/2021,I stay for one night and want to use my upgrade room and free breakfast voucher.

Sanctoo Suites & Villas,Amazing Experience,08/01/2021,"Pilihan yang tepat untuk staycation di Sanctoo. Mengapa? Karena pihak hotel terbukti sudah menjalankan semua prosedur protokol kesehatan. Mulai dari screening suhu tubuh hingga disinfektan kamar dan area public. Yang membuat terkesan adalah kamar diberikan stiker “Room is Sanitized” sebagai tanda bahwa kamar hotel yang diberikan benar-benar steril. Kamar super bersih dan dilengkapi 2 masker. Kulkas mini bar. Yang membuat terkesan ialah pemandangan dari kaca kamarnya. Berasa Magic banget dan healing. Bukti: photo yang tanpa filter-filter. Saat breakfast pun semua sudah mengikutin standar protokol kesehatan dan meminimalisir resiko kontak dengan tamu lainnya. Meskipun ala carte, semua makanannya ENAK! Ga ada yang gagal, se-ENAK itu semua makanannya dan jusnya pun fresh. …"

Le Méridien Bali Jimbaran,Pandemic Vacation,09/01/2021,"After 1.5 years of not having vacation, I finally dare myself to book a Bali vacation. I found a very good promotions for this hotel through a travel agent I found in Instagram. I booked for 4 days and 3 nights without any expectations. This hotel is located at Jimbaran, right next to the seafood bbq warungs. There's a door that can access directly to the warungs, and there's a small foot path that can access directly to the beach. I arrive around 11 AM, a bit early from their check in time at 3 PM (waaay too early). The staffs are very friendly, they took care of me and my partner. The hotel itself is a bit quiet, probably because it's still morning, but I guess their occupancy when I was there less than 30 rooms. They checked me in and gave me an upgrade! They upgraded my…"

Cause this was the second time here at Conrad Bali, we knew where we wanted to just relax and enjoy a good book. We choose to sit near the beach using a gazebo. We where greeted by the great staff. For lunch well we decided we wanted to keep it simple and western, so we ordered a pizza margherita, a smoothie mix of bananas and strawberries and a chocolate milkshake.

Staff are nice as always. 3. Breakfast and room services are okay. No complaints. 4. Before we came. We were told that dogs are only allowed in the room. They will not be allowed in common areas. But when we were there, people were bringing their dogs to the pool, and outdoor dining area. So we were eating in close proximity to slobbering dogs. Some dogs were urinating in the outside dining area. We are dog lovers too. But we certainly do not bring them to eat and swim with…"

I stayed at a beautiful one-bedroom villa with a private pool overlooking the lush green forest. I took time to reflect by reading my old journals and writing by the pool. I had dinner at The Kelusa by myself. The restaurant's staff and front desk have been amazingly helpful and kind to make sure I have everything that I need. I slept through the night on Samsara's amazing comfortable bed. When I wake up, it was drizzling rain and I decided to stay in bed and called the restaurant to have my breakfast delivered to my room.

I spend 2 nights in Samsara, celebrated my wedding anniversary, and they prepared the cake and the tub nicely. I also got a flute as a souvenir, but sadly I don't know how to play it :( Another thing that I love about Samsara is the signature fragrance. I can smell it from the bath amenities, even from the hand spray. I hope that someday they will sell them as a merchandise. Thank you for all of the good time, Samsara.^-^"

And no one can peek to your outdoor area. So you got to enjoy it to the fullest. The super cool part is they have warmer for the private pool. Swimming at night, with the chill weather of Ubud, and warm pool all to yourself, it was just perfect for me and my spouse. All of the staff was also so friendly and helpful. From the reception desk, to restaurant waiters. I really enjoyed my time in Samsara and you should too."

We recommend you to try any dish with Balinese taste, such as betutu cannelloni, the taste is sooo good, I can eat them all day. We have a chance to try the spa also, and it really worth to try so relaxing. Staycation at samsara Ubud will always be in our checklist. We'll definitely will be back. For sure. Awesooomeeeee...."

Sadara Boutique Beach Resort Bali,"Beautiful Rooms, Lush Gardens, Perfect Service, Amazing View",08/01/2021,"I booked a night here in August just because I wanted to get away from Kerobokan and needed a break. Tanjung Benoa is so quiet now and I thought I could do my part in supporting Bali's tourism, no matter how small. Anyway, I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. Everything was great. The staff members were friendly and helpful, the room was perfect and clean with a very comfortable bed, sofa and chairs, very cold AC, and a lovely terrace with a garden view. I really loved the garden. I would sit under the big tree with my laptop and watch the birds fly by. I also liked the restaurant and the sea view. The pool was also really good - the water was fresh and clean and did not hurt my eyes. So all in all, I give this hotel 10/10. I would love to stay again someday. Thank…"
Tejaprana Bisma,exceptional services,09/01/2021,"We are traveling more than two weeks in Bali. We stayed in several different 5 stars hotels. But we were still amazed by this one. Everyone we came across in the hotel were super nice. It's the most worthit hotel we've stayed in. The manager Yuli was very professional, she helped us solved our problem with the traffic polices. They came to us just right after I called which I didn't expect. During our stay, we used the hotel car rental service. We had a nice trip with Veda who drove us around. He was a good driver and a very nice fun person to have conversations with. We felt like we made a friend in our trip. Thanks to him we had some knowledges of local culture now. Usually I would consider staying in hotels would lose connection with the local people. This hotel changed my…"
Tejaprana Bisma,Perfect getaway,09/01/2021,"Everything was perfect. Located at central ubud but tucked away at Bisma street giving you the peaceful and quitness getaway you need. Spotless clean. Big villa, with outdoor tub and plunge pool looking thru the valley. Becareful dont forget to close bedroom doors at night since it is near the ' monkey forest', possibility of monkeys may get near, though we didnt encounter with them. Breakfast was delicious, kalyana resto only open for breakfast due to pandemi. Great job, Tejaprana bisma"
W Bali - Seminyak,A Wonderful Stay,09/01/2021,"This trip was to celebrate my daughter's birthday. The W team did an excellent job to surprise her. I specially thank to Imam, who arranged the birthday decoration. We all had a wonderful time in W. The view from the suite was stunning. Kids loved the pool and the beach. Hotel guests can directly access to the beach. A morning walk on the beach gave you a fresh start of the day! Tried the food in Fire restaurant and Woobar. Love the pizza and the environment of Woobar. We could stay there forever! W gave us an unforgettable Bali experience. The whole team welcome us warmly. Keep up the great job and we will be back for sure!"
W Bali - Seminyak,WORST service EVER… WORST.. EVER..,10/01/2021,"Dear W Hotel, please please fix your service.. This is the first time I feel so stressful booking a hotel, even before staying at the hotel. Truly just experienced the WORST service ever in my life. Booked the hotel early september, we stayed at several hotels including Mulia, Como, Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons. In the middle of the trip, our family caught Covid19 so we have to stop the trip.. Rescheduling was not allowed by W hotel.. The travel agent asked me to contact W hotel, and W hotel asked me to contact Travel Agent.. went thru so long and difficult process. While everything was made arranged so smoothly at Four Seasons Hotel. I could not provide the exact date of traveling back since I did not know the exact date of next travelling since one family still in covid19.…"
W Bali - Seminyak,Truly an amazing hotel.,09/01/2021,"The hotel's main entrance looked like an alley between buildings, for the newcomers they won't really notice there's a big establishment of W Hotels inside. The pathways took our breath away until we reached the hotel main lobby. Truly it felt like being brought to another amazing world. The front office lady was also friendly, and we were taken by buggy/caddy into the hotel. I was speechless, what an amazing view, really have different vibe from photos on the web and looking it firsthand. The villa is astonishing as well, with private pool and the wedding decor on table. The interior is super lovely. The price was really worth it for our honeymoon trip. The room is already cleaned, AC already on, music played and so on. Our villa was also placed close to the parking, a few…"

The Lovina,Excellent family friendly property...,10/01/2021,"We recently stayed at The Lovina with a couple of other families and had a wonderful time. The resort has been really well maintained during the pandemic and the rooms were clean and very well set up. We stayed in the Poolside Suites and found them to be an excellent choice with kids who are constantly in and out of the pool. Plus the kitchen facilities allowed us to prepare food for the fussier members of the group easily while the adults enjoyed the restaurant. The stand out for us though were the excellent staff. Friendly, polite and very helpful - nothing was too much trouble. There were many young trainees too and it was evident that the experienced staff were invested in training the newbies. All in all - a lovely break from the south of the island and would highly…"

They use glass wall so the room look spacious and you have good view of the private pool. Bed was comfy & room was clean. Bathroom was nice with a big bathtub designed for two. The main pool was big, they also have gym with decent equipments. Bar on 2nd floor, nice to have an afternoon drink. Breakfast was yummy. I tried their floating breakfast at my private pool. Afternoon tea was also splendid. Beware of the monkeys though as the location is near the Monkey Forest. Never let your room left open."

Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Amazing escape,10/01/2021,"This was our first time to Sideman and the amazing Samanvaya Resort. We spent 3 days chasing waterfalls, relaxing poolside and being pampered at the Day Spa. The staff were incredible from the moment we arrived, making our stay extra special with their professional approach and friendly smiles. We will be back."
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Jewel In Sideman's Crown,10/01/2021,"I don’t know where to start. I am a very fussy traveler and being in the hotel industry I pick up on very small details. Samanvaya was faultless. It is so clear to be that this place is so loved. Not only are the staff incredibly happy and so well trained but the maintenance, fixtures, fittings and details are perfectly formed. The spa is world class with innovative treatments I recommend the heavenly romance package. The room was divine with two balconies looking out of the organic gardens to the ocean beyond and surrounded by hills. The bed was super soft and we had the best sleeps we have had in years. Going to sleep with the sound of nature it was so peaceful. The hot tub, the pools, all the pool cabanas to relax in and so many peaceful nooks to just curl up and read…"
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,One of the best stay ever,10/01/2021,We stayed in Samanvaya almost one week and we felt so comfortable there. The Staff is very helpful and reliable. Also the Spa there is very very good. The massage lady Aliya is a really nice person and her skills are incredible. Also the food was very very delicious and the rooms have been just so nice and added with nice little details. We will definately come back again and enjoy an other stay with samanvaya. Terima kasih banyak.
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Just rebooked,10/01/2021,"we had such a great stay here..the staff were genuinely lovely and friendly and very professional,the room was very well done all very natural and blended in perfectly with the surroundings, the gardens are beautiful. The spa and restaurant exceeded our expectations. The resort gave us such a good feeling of well being we can't wait to visit again."
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,A relaxing break surrounded by greenery,09/01/2021,"We have just spent 2 nights at the hotel, staying in a lumbung style room. The room allowed for privacy and it came with great views across the valley. What you have to remember is that the lumbung’s are made of bamboo and alangalang, so there is not much sound proofing. It was not an issue as the hotel was not full. However on our 2nd night the couple next door had a blazing argument and it was as if they were in our room (not the hotels fault that they have disrespectful guests). The bed was so comfy and we both slept really well. The hotel provide you with a mobile in your room so you can whatsapp reception if you require anything while you are at the hotel. So each morning we would send a message about what we would like for breakfast and at what time. It was…"
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,"Beautiful Area, Heavenly Spa, Unsatisfying Overall Hotel Experience",09/01/2021,I'll start with the good: 1. The area - being able to walk or bicycle around Sideman was really amazing! Definitely take your bike to the surrounding waterfalls and take a walk down to the rice fields from the resort. 2. The Spa - Easily the best spa experience of my life. My girlfriend and I got the 90-min body wrap and it was so insanely relaxing. The spa is absolutely 5-star! 3. Bed - the bed was really comfy and we slept like babies. The Bad: 1. The food - we had heard from a friend that the food was not good when they came so we ate out for lunch and then for dinner just had a small snack. Both my girlfriend and I are vegan and the first dish that we ordered came to our room and included a side with egg in it. This was after specifying with the hotel staff multiple…
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Beautiful weekend getaway,08/01/2021,The staff pampers you with breakfast on your own balcony and bringing anything you might need right to your room within minutes. The views over the mountains are so relaxing and the total stay just slows down time - in a great way!
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Serene and fresh air,08/01/2021,"We came based on pasy reviews and very pleased with our stay. This place is so serene, the air is so pure and fresh, we sleep with the window open. The restaurant serves delicious meals, all the dishes that we tried are worthy of Michellin Star. Staffs are warm and helpful. Will come back in the future for sure."
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Beautiful Escape in the mountains,08/01/2021,"From arrival to departure, each moment of our stay was magic. Set upon a hillside in Sideman, you can watch the sunset + sunrise from your bed - with the folding doors wide one. Frogs and geckos create the soundtrack as you laze around the two pools, sipping on cocktails or green juice. The food is beyond phenomenal. A huge NZ influence on the menu - and every meal was outstanding. Favourites was the gnocci + fish tacos. Ogik and Langkir were the absolute friendliest hosts who looked after us so well at every meal. We will be back there for sure!"
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,It rained the whole time AND IT WAS AMAZING,08/01/2021,"Spent a few days here last week with my girlfriend and I have to say it was amazing. The location is beautiful, the service is great and the food is incredible. We had a couples massage at the spa and I was super impressed with the therapists. Yes it rained the whole time so we didn't go far from the resort but it was super cozy listening to the rain from our room. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be returning."
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Amazing Stay at Samanvaya,08/01/2021,"Stayed a couple of nights at Samanvaya and had the most relaxing time! Just what I needed for a little break from work. It was raining most of the time when I was there but it doesn't reduce my experience at all. I even loved the rain and the chill vibes. My favorite was waking up in the morning opening the blind to the beautiful hills view. A perfect way to start the day. Another highlight was their food at the Asri Dining.. OMG... every single meal I tried was mouthwatering.... food were delicious across the menu, from breakfast, lunch and dinner, always looking forward when it's meal time. Must try! I highly recommend Samanvaya if you want to escape to east Bali! Must go!"

Adiwana Bisma,Lovely family stay in central Ubud,09/01/2021,We booked 2 nights in this resort . However we extended for another 2 nights since we loved the team and the rooms . The pool has an amazing view overlooking the river and the jungle. It was very relaxing for us with 2 kids. The hotel is very close to the center of ubud with plenty of restaurant options. The food in pistachio restaurant was also great . Only downside was that breakfast was a bit slow . But we understand that during covid the social distancing might effect this. Would definitely recommend
Adiwana Bisma,Really love this place!!!,10/01/2021,Everything about this hotel blows my mind! The place is really relaxing and would be perfect if you are searching for a place to just chill and enjoy the vibes. The service is immaculate and really helpful.

Adiwana ricefield view ruangannya luas baik di bagian ruangan tidur, kamar mandi, maupun balkon dengan pemandangan sawah. Kamar mandi yang luas dibagi dalam 3 area dan toiletries yang lengkap dengan aroma yang khas. Rooftop pool juga nyaman untuk berenang dengan view yang indah.

Pasti akan kembali jika berkunjung ke Ubud!"

I couldn’t have asked for more form the hotel during my stay. My room was so clean with a beautiful view of the jungle and a nice balcony perfect for working remotely. I loved the infinity pool. Didn’t miss the ocean while relaxing up there. I had too relaxing spa treatments with the current promotions. They also understand what vegan means and were accommodating for my daily breakfast. Loved the views at the restaurant of the rice fields.

Staff were exceptionally helpful and courteous, while maintaining safe social distances and observing important COVID-19 protocols. We loved all of our meals at the Octagon restaurant, the afternoon tea, and the picnic lunch they prepared for us. The menu had fantastic options both from its Western and Indonesian sides, and we were surprised that they were able to offer a full menu despite what we assumed to be low occupancy rates. In the end, the only effect that we noticed was that we had the staff's undivided attention, and felt very well looked after. Our room was wonderful as well - designed in a cabin style, but equipped with a comfy A/C, strong wi-fi, and a TV so we didn't…"

Thank’s to Mr. Putu and mbak Sri for the hospitality, and Mr. Bimbi, we had a great talk that morning. I’m sure you can make it even better and better. I can’t wait to go back again with my children, I’m sure they’re gonna love it.

Padahal konsepnya keren banget dan view nya bagus banget.. Lobby dan staf nya jg baik.. driver/ranger pak Kadek yg ajak kami keliling tour sangat baik..

Bed & Breakfast Aquaterrace,Great stay at Bunutan area,09/01/2021,"Note that this is in the bunutan area, near japanese shipwreck and 20minutes from amed centre. Long drive from Kuta, but greeted with delicious pinnaple juice and cold towel, very nice. Nice staff as well. They have 2 types of room. Hill and Ocean that are on seperated buildings just about 50m apart. We stayed at the Terrace Hill room 2nd floor, the biggest one with a bathtub, on the hillside but very much had a lovely wide view of the ocean. Room was big and clean with minibar, kettle, toiletries using sensatia botanical. Windows at the bathroom was not cleaned from outside, maybe missed that. If only, a tv would be nice when staycation-ing. AC would have been better if put at the back. Opening the doors at nighy was not an option, since there was a cat that likes to hang out…"
Tauch Terminal Resort Tulamben & Spa,Perfect place to dive and stay!,10/01/2021,"Dive: I had a great time learning how to dive here. Peter, the instructor, was really friendly and answered all my questions happily even months before I got there 😃 I started out pretty scared but in the end did 10 dives including the open water and advanced adventurer certification within 5 days. I always learn something new and receive helpful feedback on what I did well and what to improve on every dive, and was given just the right balance of independence and help. It was a really fun learning experience, and definitely makes me want to explore and learn more! The dive sites are all very close (one literally in front of the dive base in the resort, one wreck just a short walk away, one a short bike ride away), accessible for beginners, and are all very interesting (I saw…"

Artotel Haniman Ubud,Hideout boutique hotel in Ubud,08/01/2021,Sometimes Ubud can be a little bit too nature-y. This place provides a simple modern escapade in the heart of Ubud.

"Capella Ubud, Bali",Beautiful surroundings and a unique experience,09/01/2021,"We enjoyed a quick one night stay at The Photographer's tent at Capella Ubud and it was incredible. It was our first Bill Bensley experience and the level of detailing on decor in our tent and the entire resort was amazing. The morning view from our private pool and balcony overlooking the rainforest valley carved by the Wos River provided such a peaceful way to start off the day. The Spa massage was one of the best we had, and the genuine service from the talented team truly made us feel like royalty during our couples getaway. Will hope to be back to explore more and ""recharge our batteries"" again."
"Capella Ubud, Bali",New luxury hotel in Ubud,09/01/2021,"I had the opportunity to try the breakfast at the Capella Hotel in Ubud. It is remarkable in every way, the setting is magnificent. From the restaurant you can enjoy a beautiful view of the swimming pool and the jungle. The food is of a very good standard and the staff are very friendly and very professional. I was kindly offered to visit one of their tents, which I accepted with great pleasure. The inside of the tents is just beautiful, it's very warm, the materials are of very good quality. I recommend choosing a tent with a view of the valley, it is really beautiful, I can't wait to stay there."
"Capella Ubud, Bali",Next level luxury glamping,09/01/2021,"Amazing everything. A new level of camping that brought the nostalgia of camping as a child but on a completely new level. The Amazake lunch carefully and passionately presented by Chef Nico and his team made us feel like royalty dining in the stunning jungle atmosphere. A visit to one of the “tents” with everything and anything you could dream of…. Picture a royal throne(toilet) and copper bathtub, four poster bed with a jungle view worth lying in for and a mini bar that leaves every desire within reach…. had me wishing I had arranged for a stay. On the list for an upcoming staycation for sure. The icing on the cake was the amazing staff who not only took care of our every need but the warm appreciation they showed to us for visiting. X"

The staff welcoming me warmly and they did any effort to make my stay comfortable.

The villa has a fully equipped kitchen so if you wanna prepare your meals there you can easily do. In the neighborhood there are plenty of cafes, pubs and warung anyway my recommendation is to rent a motorbike to can easily wonder around avoiding to be stuck in the traffic.

Grand Mirage Resort & Thalasso Spa - Bali,Worst customer service I’ve ever received.,09/01/2021,"We booked this hotel for our 10 year anniversary for 2020 and we’re not able to go due to the shut down of Bali and restrictions into Indonesia. The hotel refused to refund our hotel and instead gave us a further two years to rebook. It is now September 2021, it’s been 2 years and we still can’t go as there are restrictions and we were made redundant from our jobs. We humbly requested that the hotel do as many airlines and hotels have and refund us as we haven’t been able to make it this far and are in a difficult financial situation to come in the near future. The hotel agreed on only a 50% refund of $5000 and I thought this was unreasonable especially as hotels and airlines around the world are refunding due to the pandemic being no fault of ours and more the countries locked…"
Grand Inna Kuta,murah di masa pandemi,10/01/2021,"menginap di hotel ini semalam setelah tiba dari surabaya di sore hari. kamar masih cukup terawat, harga pandemi sangat murah, tidak sampai 300k. padahal sebelum pandemi sempat menginap di hotel ini diatas 1jt untuk jenis kamar yang sama. hotel sudah cukup ramai, menerapkan protokol kesehatan cukup baik. makan pagi hampir semua meja penuh terisi. makan buffet, namun diambilkan oleh pegawai hotel. Dari area makan pagi ada akses langsung ke pantai, namun ramai penjual/jasa pijat, sehingga kurang nyaman."
Grand Inna Kuta,Tingkatkan dan pertahankan,09/01/2021,"hotel dan pelayanannya sangat bagus, tinggal meningkatkan dan mempertahankan semua pelayanan, mulai dari penerimaan tamu sampai tamu keluar dari hotel. Yang agak kurang ok, front office kurang respon, harus lebih baik"
Grand Inna Kuta,Review singkat,09/01/2021,"Sya menginap disini slma pandemi, di deluxe with sea view dan deluxe room. Dari segi harga, harga termasuk murah utk hotel sekelas ini, apalagi posisi hotel tepat didepan pintu masuk kota, dan tmpt breakfastnya menghadap lgsg ke pantai kuta. Utk stafnya ramah2. Interiornya cukup bagus, tidak terlalu mewah, sama spt interior hotel lain. Bangunannya sih sprtnya udh cukup tua. Utk kamar deluxe with sea view dan deluxe room, menurut saya interiornya dan fasilitas sama persis yg membedakan hanya view lautannya saja. Klo mencari hotel yg menghadap lgsg ke pantai kuta, tempat ini bisa dicoba."

Amnaya Resort Kuta,Hidden gem di Kuta,10/01/2021,"Aku menginap 2 kali di waktu yang berbeda dan mengambil kamar yang paling murah. Saking sukanya sama hotel ini, aku mau mengulas dengan detail (sayangnya lagi nggak bisa simpan foto jadi nggak bisa melampirkan foto apapun disini) Pertama, walau letak hotelnya di jalan yang sempit, tapi lokasinya sangat strategis. Tinggal jalan sedikit, sangat dekat mall Discovery, pantai, bandara, waterbom. Mungkin karena pandemi, jadi banyak toko dan resto yang tutup. Kalau ingin ke tempat makan yang lumayan banyak yang buka, Kuta Square juga bisa ditempuh beberapa meter saja. Tapi overall lokasinya sangat menjanjikan. Kedua, pelayanannya sangat memuaskan. Walau staf terbatas, tapi mereka sangat profesional dan ramah ke semua tamunya. Mulai dari satpam, resepsionis, yang bagian membersihkan…"

While the longest time I've stayed in a hotel is 50 days, the name of which is Amnaya Resort Kuta, and I can't wait to go back there. Whenever I travel to a place the most important thing to me is the people. I'm all about making connections, building relationships. Because it is the key to happiness. And that exactly what I found at Amnaya Resort Kuta. Yoga, the resort manager, and every single one of his staff meant it when they greeted and asked me,""Selamat pagi, Pak Yesa! Apa kabar?"". How could I tell if they're being sincere? Because I would take them up on it and engage them in conversations that could last up to 15 minutes (yeah, I can be…"

Amnaya Resort Kuta,4 star hotel that incredibly feels like 5 star hotel.,09/01/2021,"During this hard time, hotels (specially in Bali) reduce their employees. I’ve been to 5 star hotels in Bali that have more employee, but I’ve never felt so much welcomed like in Amnaya. Their hospitality is beyond my expectation for 4 star hotel. I have no complaints at all. We reaaaally really love the layout of the bedroom, we had it connecting to our nanny’s bedroom. It’s spacious & nice. I feel very comfortable staying at Amnaya. Love every details, looks like they’re very thoughtful about every single thing. That really makes me enjoy my holiday with my family to the fullest. You need to try it for yourself and see that I’m right!"

Amnaya Resort Kuta,Staff ramah dan tempatnya tenang,08/01/2021,"Saat check in, staff nya menawarkan upgrade kamar yang menghadap kolam renang dengan tambahan biaya. Kami menyetujuinya dan mendapatkan kamar di pinggir kolam renang. Interior kamar persis dengan Amnaya Benoa, tetapi Amnaya Benoa terlihat lebih baru. Ada bath tub terpisah, di dalam shower hanya ada rain shower. Selama dua malam di Amnaya Kuta, selalu ada beberapa ekor nyamuk. Mungkin karena kamar kami dekat dengan kolam renang serta pepohonan kecil. Saat kami tinggal di sana, SPA sedang tutup karena PPKM. Overall, kami senang tinggal di Amnaya Kuta."

Surprisingly their quality of service is even upgraded during this hard situation. The staff were so humble and friendly. They help me to find best room, even offered me to upgrade my room. Really another great stay there, where I really enjoyed the clean spacious room with nice bath tub in it. As an architect my self, I should give applause to the designer of the bed room. It's really good looking and hommy. The room with pool access was the best. Try to spend your morning coffee at the terrace under there tree shade and pool view. Feel sad when I have to leave for check out. Good job Amnaya Kuta! Hoping this hard time will over…"

Sheraton Bali Kuta Resort,Very Recommended Hotel in Kuta Area,10/01/2021,"The rooms are very good and well maintained, the check-in process is also very easy and without problems. Our room was upgraded with a beautiful beach view. For breakfast according to 5-star hotel standards, it's just that the variety is a bit lacking. For the service of all hotel staff, it's very good, it's just that the front lobby staff slightly differentiates the car park according to the type of car :) because we used a cheap rental car, we asked to park a bit far away, while behind us there was a more expensive car that could be parked right in front lobby."
"Hotel Indigo Bali Seminyak Beach, an IHG hotel",The nicest place on seminyak. Thank you Indigo,10/01/2021,"The hotel is beautiful. The lights and the art . I got something to complain.

I found a very good promotions for this hotel through online travel agents. I booked for 3 days and 2 nights for their wangsa one bedroom pool villa. This hotel is located at a quiet side of Seminyak, at the end of Jl. Camplung Tanduk, it's a beachfront hotel. I arrive around 1 PM, a bit early from their check in time at 3 PM (waaay too early). But my villa wasn't ready until almost 3.30 PM. The staffs are very friendly, they took care of me and my partner. The hotel itself is a bit quiet, I guess their occupancy when I was there less than 30 rooms. Their villas located at the different area with their main building. To go to the villas, they prepare buggies, since a little bit far from…"

"Hotel Indigo Bali Seminyak Beach, an IHG hotel",Recommended Stay at Indigo Seminyak!! One of the best hotel in Bali 🔥,08/01/2021,Literally one of the best hotel to stay during Pandemic. They really took seriously this pandemic and follows all the protocol sets by the Government!! Pros: 1.The staffs are very very friendly and polite + helpful 2.We literally allowed to stay late until 2pm (this is very helpful to us bear in mind that our flight is on 6pm) 3. Big A** Pool in each of Villa (It feels surreal) 4. Nice and Very Aesthetically pleasing Interior design of the villa itself Cons: 1.Too bad the nearest minimart is closed so it kinda hard to buy anything within walking distance 2. Access to this hotel kinda dark during night. But the hotel itself very bright Overall i will definitely recommend to everyone to stay at this magnificent hotel! Will be back soon. Thank you indigo for making my stays…
"Hotel Indigo Bali Seminyak Beach, an IHG hotel",Home Away From Home!,08/01/2021,As frequent northern Bali travelers when we came to the south to find a home we were overwhelmed. Our Indigo representative solved all our problems by booking us an extended stay in a beautiful villa fully equipped with all of our wants and needs including a PS4! We have a nut and coconut allergy and the staff was fully aware making sure to alter their menu to fit our needs. Never were we worried which gave us a great peace of mind. After staying for 2 months the lovely staff became an extension of our family. We know everyone by name and they knew ours. They did a fabulous job of anticipating our needs and helping us practice our Bahasa. We truly appreciate all of the love we experienced at Hotel Indigo Seminyak Beach. It will forever be a favorite in our books. Other hotels do…

Melali Bingin,Relaxing peace of heaven!,09/01/2021,"Staying at Melali is the closest feeling to home I’ve had in Bali. I’m so grateful to have made this connection with Liam and Elise and to have found this little slice of paradise in Bali. They really make it a point to think of all the little details and their willingness to accommodate with such joy makes it that much more of a pleasant experience! I really feel so comfortable and relaxed when I stay here and the level of cleanliness brings a great sense of ease! I have now stayed with them a few times and will continue to stay there whenever I’m in Uluwatu! A special thanks to Elise and Liam and their incredible staff for always making my stay so enjoyable! You are an exceptional team! Staying at Melali is an absolute dream. With love, Danielle ❤️"
Melali Bingin,Incredible Getaway,09/01/2021,"I’ve stayed at Melali multiple times to escape from every day stress and totally unwind. They really look after you here, more that just a guest and take care of you like family. Melali is a beautiful place to stay and experience surrounding beaches and cafes but what sets Melali apart from other accomodation is the personal touch and energy the owners bring to your stay away from home. I love the morning light and surrounding lush nature, the epic breakfast and the just chilling in and around the pool with nothing to do but chillax all day long if you choose too."
Alila Ubud,Mixed feeling.,10/01/2021,"The hotel room was really great. The service was also very great. What disappointed me is that my girlfriend getting an allergic reaction once entering the villa room. However, the hotel staff did us a very great favor of exchanging the room. Unfortunately, the allergic reaction stayed. We have made some plans during out visit to Ubud but we could not really enjoy it. We supposed to get 3 spas session but we have to cancel 1. We got a morning trekking activity, but need to cancel it. We also have a free photoshoot session but could not take it as the allergic reaction hinder us to enjoy our time. We would also wake up at night due to the itch. The worst part is actually that this is the last holiday we could take this year and we were not able to enjoy our time. However, all in…"

Alila Ubud,The best hotel resort in the world,09/01/2021,"I came to Alila Ubud on my honeymoon in 2016. I left a review then but i can’t find it anymore so I thought I’d write another one. This resort is hands down the best hotel resort in the world. It is simply stunning, the attention to detail in every aspect of the design is impeccable. The service is wonderful, you are not just treated like royalty but as if you are the most important guests. The food is some of the finest I have ever tasted. Everything is designed to help you capture everything that Bali has to offer and delight every one of your senses. To this day I still miss the taste of the afternoon tea, the smell of lemongrass and the sound of the gekko’s in the morning. Sunbathing whilst watching the monkeys in the trees and enjoying the stunning sunsets is the…"

The sales/booking team was excellent, check-in and our villa was lovely (the jungle surrounds are amazing), the restaurant/room service provided delicious food, and the communal pool and view/surrounds make a stay worthwhile for them alone. Best holiday I've had since I can remember."

He is really a good leader…"

Banyak fasiltas yang fleksibel. Salah satunya adalah early check-in dan late check-out (maks jam 16.00). Promo room ratenya sangat terjangkau untuk fasilitas seperti Lagoon Access Junior Suite yang terletak di lantai 1 dan langsung akses kolam dari teras kamar.

Meliá Bali,suck hotel,10/01/2021,"Initially my husband and I stayed at this hotel, the service was good and as expected, then I recommended the family to stay at Melia Bali, but the second time I went to Melia this hotel service became very bad, the receptionist and management were very unprofessional, just because we bought at a promo price he said many times, and the one who apologized was not the management but the security guard, and what was even crazier, the receptionist without apologizing to us returned our money"

Cons, the jet spray in the toilet too short. Will definitely come back to Melia Bali!"
Meliá Bali,Average Hotel,09/01/2021,"We stayed at the Melia for 2 nights. Would have stayed for 5 but decided to go home early. Pros. Very friendly staff, they are so helpful and professional, beautiful hotel grounds. Clean and comfy beds. Beautiful views. Our headboard was filthy and the staff arrived within minutes to clean and change the bedsheets. Cons. The pool has no shade so you can't swim in the day. The bath and bathroom is very tiny. My husband was to tall to shower and to tall for the bath. Water doesn't get hot and the plug didn't work so the water runs out quickly, enamel comes off in the tub. They have these beautiful cabanas on the beach that don't allow children. Also you have to pay extra if you want the privilege of using it. Pretty ridiculous considering that there was no one around. I hate to…"
Meliá Bali,A Lovely Weekend,09/01/2021,"Visited Melia for a workshop by the beach from 3PM to 6PM. The workshop itself provide free flow cake and drink. The staffs were very friendly, always a smile on their face. They give us info about the current event and upcoming event. The one served us were Aris and Pak Eky. Both were very helpful and it’s nice when your waiter/waitress called you by your name, not just some generic “mba” or “ibu”. Before we went home, they gave us some complimentary cake for takeaway! It was the weekend and there was Weekend Carnival and I saw lot of activities for the kid and for the family. There were two entertainers; Alep and Ian.

Amarterra Villas Bali Nusa Dua - MGallery,Amarterra Villa - 4*s for me,09/01/2021,"We went here for a short stay for 2 nights at Amazonian 3 - 2bedrooms pool villa. The villa itself is spacious with a complete amenities. + Location is great, you can never find bad hotel and villa in Nusa Dua area especially in ITDC Bali area. + Spacious villa and clean pool + Food was really delicious, especially the one made by Chef Made Bagus. It was a great experience to enjoy his hospitality and food made by him! + There is one staff we met from Social Media marketing named Putri - also very attentive and show us around the spot. Thumbs up! - TVs channel selection! Only local channel? Not more than 20 selections? - Understaffed? This was my assumption because I would expect prompt response on queries - Not a big fan of main bathroom curtain / blind selection"
Amarterra Villas Bali Nusa Dua - MGallery,Decent Villa in Nusa Dua,08/01/2021,"Overall the Villas are nice and the staff are very helpful and attentive. Special thank to pak Komang, pak Julian and pak Aslan who have help me during my stay to fix many things. The team have done a great job to make my stay become enjoyable. The only draw back that need to be improved is the water as somehow the tap water has some taste like salty and like brakish water, so do do not feel good when brushing your teeth or when showering as well. According to them, it comes from PDAM which I am not quite sure as the other hotel in Nusa Dua does not have that issue, because prior to staying in Amarterra, I was staying in another hotel which is only 600 meter away and I did not have the water issue. Other than this water issue, everything else is great."

We had a 1 bedroom villa which has an open lounge dining area, luxurious bedroom, separate dressing area and work desk and a large bathroom with a spa bath, separate shower and toilet, all of which were beautifully appointed and meticulously maintained. We were greeted at the front and escorted to reception and we were checked in by Aslan (who we had met previously) who was excited to see us back and explained the current operations of the hotel. We were escorted to the villa which when entering still has that WOW factor even though we had stayed there before. We had a late lunch in the restaurant which although has a reduced menu stilll has a…"

The rooms are beautifully crafted and detailed with 2 day beds, shower, bath, plenty of hot water, and good wifi. The views from rooms look over the lush valley towards 'Bridges' and forest. We came for Ubud Writers Festival, which was located only about 200m down the way and very close to the centre of ubud and all restaurants etc. Staff were superb with excellent English and gave us a free 1 hour trek along rice padi and views across the valley - so nice. Honestly, can not recommend this place enough for luxurious and smart/considerate set out of amenities - high quality bed, thin and thick pillows, international plugs both side of bed .... Beautiful"

Water heater not working at first, but after i call the operator they fixed it. please be prepare check the panels etc. checking the panels should be before we come right? 3. So many bugs outside ( i know it's an outdoor amd tropical country but haven't see so many in just a moment ) 4. the pillow as hard as rock 5. we can't use the AC on the eating room ( they plugged out the cables ) 6. The house keeping come into your room without your permission in behalf of checked the electricity 😒 pros : …"

The property is also nice, especially the room. It's big, spacious, and designed well. Love the gazebo, I spent most of my time here working with a nice view, timr really does fly when you're in a very nice hotel. They offers fun activities too, one of them is going to bat cave and see the bats fly out when the sun sets.

Mulia Resort,Unpleasant experience,10/01/2021,"1. We booked for double bed, but they gave us twin bed. We need to complain first then they will try to find the replacement room. 2. There’s no clear signage inside the resort. It’s confusing to find a way. 3. Some staffs are nice and kind, but others are below 5 stars standard 4. There’s regulation that men can’t use tank top inside the restaurant. Idk what is the reason. Body odor? If yes, then why they allowed women to use it. Even women can use tank top, hot pants, crop top, etc. 5. Wifi only limited to 3 devices. As you might now, nowadays people can have more than 2 devices. What kind of regulation is that? Even most of cheap hotel and villa doesn’t limit their wifi like that. Ridiculous. (The speed of their wifi also terrible)"

Mulia Resort,Memorable stay ever,10/01/2021,"One of our best stay in Bali. Room size was 5 stars hotel standard but very clean and tidy, big fridge, closet equipped with Toto Washlet. The view from lobby was mesmerizing overlooking to the ocean with plenty of greeneries. All the staffs have remarkable skill and world class services. Special appreciation to Pak Edy from the beach bar who has been a good company and told us lots of things to maximize our stay in the property. I guess Mulia has scaled down their breakfast buffet standard but still maintain a decent quality of food. We are not a big eater, so we don't really mind. Enjoy lunch at Soleil and Ala Carte dinner at The Cafe. Oxtail soup and the grill salmon was the highlight. Well done Mulia. You deserve all the world awards of hospitality."
Mulia Resort,Love it!,09/01/2021,"This was my second stay at Mulia Bali. My family and I were very satisfied and happy with our experience here. The check in took quite a while but it maybe because of my travel agent booked the wrong date, but the hotel staff gave us complimentary beverages while waiting so that was very nice of them. My kids had so much fun at the kids club & the pool. The breakfast was spectacular and they had a very good safety protocol. I even came back twice for dinner at the cafe. I stayed at 5 different 5-stars hotels on this trip but I can say that I like Mulia the best. All the staffs are well trained and they gave the best hospitality. Would definitely come back :)"

Very beautiful resort indeed. All the staff is also very kind, helpful and attentive. We joined some activities prepared by the hotel, such as water aerobic and canoeing. The aerobic was so much fun, but canoe will cost you since they need to engage with the third party vendor. Hope they can prepare the canoe or paddleboard on the house so the guest doesn't need to pay extra as the hotel price is already quite high. When we stayed, the hotel was very empty due to pandemics, but on the plus side we can enjoy everything without worried and we can even have the pool and beach only for ourselves! We hope that we can stay longer and joined other…"

Ever After was the first venue that we viewed, and we left with such excitement knowing that it was the venue that we wanted to get married at. It really did exceed all exceptions of how the venue looked on the day, and how the day came together. Thank you to Dany Phwa and all Mulia Resort team for the most perfect day.

It was so lovely to see it all come together so beautifully on the day – and that is all down to you guys – thank you so much again! …"

"The Stones Hotel - Legian Bali, Autograph Collection","Nice, clean",10/01/2021,"Spacious bedroom, very clean and neat. Bath area is a different story. I hate their shower knob. It's not user friendly especially for muslim because if you turn the knob too far right to stop the hand shower, the one on the ceiling start to pour all over you. We usually use shower to take wudlu with our clothes on so this would be a disaster. Happened to me the first time using it. Breakfast was excellent."
"The Stones Hotel - Legian Bali, Autograph Collection",Could have been better,10/01/2021,"There were drawbacks in the room, some rusts and stains. However, this was quickly dealt with when we raised the matter to the front desk. One main problem is that there was no running hot water. They used solar panel which depends on how sunny that day was. Shower was cold even in the afternoon on some days. The great thing is the staffs attentiveness and attitude. They were helpful in terms of doing what they can in addressing the above and made the rest of our stay better."

Hevea Villas,Just what we need for our little break from the new normal,09/01/2021,"After 3 days of road trip from Jakarta, arriving to Hevea Villa was so so so worth it. We were extremely happy to have found this villa. We stayed for 5 nights at Villa #2, it's a two bedroom villa. What really sold me about this villa is the connecting door between the bedrooms. I have a 9yo and 8yo, and the connecting door really gave me a piece of mind at night. I looked at other 2 bedroom villas, but the bedrooms are just separated too far for my liking, while a 1 bedroom is just too small for the four of us. The swimming pool was quite big, the kids reallly had a good time swimming there, me & my husband included! The villa was very clean, and I like how they thought of providing little cloth and disinfectant in every room, makes cleaning easier. They also provided…"

Sadly to said, the bfast a bit dissapointed us . There’s no any selection menu, just 1 set course without any bread or selection egg style . But, overall the rooms and amenities was really good . Ok the last one concerned, the thread mill doesn’t work properly and the gym has very limited facilities . Keep up the good work all Kamaniiya team !"
Kamaniiya Petitenget Seminyak,The location is perfect base to start Balinese island experience,08/01/2021,"I stayed in this hotel a while ago before hotel change the name into Kamaniiya, this time we still amaze with their service, we book 2 rooms for me and my parent, they offer me free upgrade with connecting and late check out, rooms are very clean and smells good. Location is just perfect to start our island experience, we will come back again !"
Bali Silent Retreat,Heaven!,08/01/2021,"it is the Silence that heals. the location is its vessel and what a vessel it is. at the foot of Mount Batu Karu with rice fields as far as the eye can see. bordering a sliver of tropical forest right down to the river. BSR sits right between, on holy grounds where healing has always happened from times past. the food its fuel, the most luxurious fuel I have ever had. vegan, grown at BSR of otherwise responsibly sourced. mealtimes are announced by a wooden gong and it will become the anchoring point in this place where time stands still. the room is a sanctuary. simple but clean with 100% cotton sheets. but the Silence is what BSR is for. calming, detoxifying, centering...a rest we all deserve. hint: read the website carefully, it is a wealth of information."
Bali Eco Stay Bungalows,The most sustainable stay in Bali,10/01/2021,"We had a lovely 5 night stay in Bali Eco Villas, surrounded by nature, waterfalls, rivers and the jungle! The beautiful jungle soundtrack at night is mesmerizing and the food cooked freshly in the restaurant comes straight from the permaculture gardens on site. We took a tour through all of the gardens and down to the private waterfall on site where you can have a private picnic made for you. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here, the staff were friendly and helpful and organized massages, picnics, walks and local knowledge about the area. We'll be back again soon we hope!"
Bali Eco Stay Bungalows,The REAL Bali experience,10/01/2021,"My absolute favoutire place to stay in Bali, a short (beautiful and scenic) drive from Bali's main tourist centre is an amazing little paradise. We chose to stay here as they have strong beliefs set within the environment and the resort is nestled within the jungle and rice paddie fields. We enjoyed the private waterfall on-site which also powers almost the entire resort! Come and stay here if you really want to turn off, wind down and really experience the raw, beautiful nature and environment of Bali. Highly recommend the salad and harvest bowls, like the rest of the menu, everything is hand picked from the gardens the morning you order it! Be sure to take a tour of the gardens and river to learn all about the permaculture they've set up. We had such a fantastic stay…"
Bali Eco Stay Bungalows,Perfect staycation to reconnect to Nature,10/01/2021,"I had a lovely weekend at Bali Eco Stay ! It’s located in the middle of nature and perfect to reconnect and reset. The place is cradled by nature which makes it so unique. The staff is very welcoming and the feed soooo delicious (they have their own food garden !!). The whole resort is an experience itself where you can stay, enjoy the waterfall but also some nice walks. Highly recommend !!"
Bali Eco Stay Bungalows,a great get away from the busy Kuta.,08/01/2021,This is nature at its best. Each cottage is nestled away by its self. You can just feel to craftsmanship that went into building theses spacious wood villas. The natural air flow is all you need to stay comfortable day and night. lets not forget about the surrounding area. Be sure to take one of the nature walks and drink in the breath taking rice fields and waterfalls. There are plenty of activities to partake in. The restaurant and staff provide a wonderful menu of western and local dishes. Another impressive note is they produce most of there own food and clean energy. This aia a place I will return to and bring friends.
Kokonut Suites,They trap you,10/01/2021,"The housekeeping was lazy, the management didnt even bother to check their work. I stayed here for 2 weeks, they tried to charge me for 4 bath towels and 3 hand towels on the last day 1 bath towel and 1 hand towel had makeup stain, which CAN BE REMOVED INSTANTLY WITH WATER. ( I REMOVED ALL THE STAINS IN 2 MINUTES ) but they said they checked and they couldnt remove it. Which they lied. Because when i confronted the housekeeping and ask how they checked, and he didnt answer me. Which really left me wonder, how do they clean their towels and bed linens. Do they even use water/soap/bleach???? The rest of the towel was not stained. Yet they are charging me for it. They showed me their towels, which are dirty and have brownish stained to even begin with. Hello, you didnt have…"
Kokonut Suites,Feels Like Home...,09/01/2021,"this is our first stay ath the suites. It was superbly amazing. The location, the staff, the room (this is outstanding) the facilities are two thumbs up. Great place for routine escape. Close to many restaurant, groceries store. We stay here with our family. Two bed room suite are great. Larga living room, dinind area and theres a working table too. Well, you still need a place to hangout with your laptop right? The kitchen was fullset with stove, water heater, fridge, microwave. Just like i said, Feels like home... we cook, eat, swim and repeat for three days. The kids love to stay there. in fact, they already request to stay there again. HIGHLY recommended...."
The Royal Beach Seminyak Bali - MGallery,A unique kind of experience,10/01/2021,"The Royal Beach Seminyak (RBS) will be always a unique place to stay. Most properties in Bali these days have lost touch of traditional architecture style, they are too modern for my taste. However, RBS managed to keep the Balinese authenticity from the exterior, interior, and more importantly the warm smiles from all the staffs (I can feel it although they’re wearing masks). 1) Reception Super easy, no hassle, the staff explains everything about the property, the surroundings, and the available facilities. They also tried to manage my expectations that services will be limited due to Level 3 of Covid restrictions, and I totally understand that. 2) Room I was staying for 3 nights in a villa unit 102. The room is huge, plenty of room, with a royal style bathtub, private pool,…"
The Royal Beach Seminyak Bali - MGallery,Comfortable room great Location,09/01/2021,"Rooms were comfortable with direct access to the beach, Relaxing by the beach every afternoon waiting for sunset, friendly local merchant in front of the hotel (Pak Wayan & his wife) We were a bit shocked when first entering the front area/main building which was abandoned but on the back/ villa areas was pretty well maintained including the main pool. The villa needs to be updated especially the outdoor area e.g. decking, outdoor furniture, However everything else was smooth. Air con was cold, hot water running well, room were clean Hope they will be back again stronger."
The Royal Beach Seminyak Bali - MGallery,Royal Beach should become Disaster Beach,09/01/2021,Booked a quick staycation at Royal Beach...somewhere I haven’t stayed for about 6 years. All good they sent me the confirmation saying my Amex had been charged and was not refundable and in order to check in I needed to provide a fully vaccinated certificate (which I am not due to medical reasons). After a bit of a discussion and proof I had attempted vaccination they agreed to a negative PCR test. Checked in and no mention of the proof from either of us. Villa wasnt ready to went and had coffee there and they called to tell us when we could go to the villa as we already had the key. The hotel looks very old and tired and slightly rundown in dire need of renovation. The villa was ocean front and view however there was a wall at the front . From inside the villa if you wanted to…
The Royal Beach Seminyak Bali - MGallery,Perfectly located paradise,08/01/2021,"This excellently located resort is simply amazing although needing some touch up. The hotel was kind enough to upgrade me to the beachfront suite which comes with its own jacuzzi and chilling gazebo which overlooks into the sea. The staff are super welcoming and friendly, they made the stay during the pandemic into a paradise and I ended up extending the stay. The hotel has one of the best location in Seminyak and direct beach access to view the perfect sunset. Thank you for an amazing stay!"
Peppers Seminyak,"Central location, attentive employee, but need to work on cleanliness",10/01/2021,"Peppers located in Petitenget, centrally located to all the fun things in Seminyak. Stayed at their 3 bedroom presidential villa for 2 nights. It is a huge villa with separated communal area and kitchen perfect for families. They have huge dining table fit for 8 person, which can be use as a WFB spot. They got wifi, standard speed, enough for 1 video conferencing meeting, but not 2 simultaneously. Rooms are big, with comfortable beds. The villa concept is modern balinese, somewhat romantic style, where bathroom are designed in open concept. They have outdoor and indoor showers as well as bath tub and separated toilet area. good health protocol upon check in where they asked our antigen results However, pandemic really hit them hard, where maybe, the villa where I stayed…"
Joe's Diving Bali - Dive Castle - Tauchburg,"Great dive centre, would highly recommend!",10/01/2021,"Myself and three friends recently completed our SSI open water certificate through Joe’s Diving Bali. The full experience from start to finish was absolutely amazing! Martin, the dive instructor, was very knowledgeable, relaxed, and had a great sense of humour! The facilities were perfect for learning how to dive and we were provided with well-kept equipment for all of the dives and activities. The price was very reasonable considering the amount that was included in course. If you are looking to complete your open water certificates or simply looking for a centre to take some dives with, I’d definitely recommend Joe’s Diving Bali!!"
Joe's Diving Bali - Dive Castle - Tauchburg,Best Dive Experience With Logical Budget,10/01/2021,This is THE BEST DIVING EVER for me. Martin is superb and he is so patience that taking me and guiding me during our diving. And the price is the cheapest one but it is not lowering the qualities. For sure i never dive with the most beautiful experiences and the most competent dive master ever. Definitely i will come back. This wont be the last time dive with Joe's diving. Thanks to Mbak Frisca too Martin's wife. She helped me to prepare my dive too. Seriously if you wish to dive to Tulamben especially Liberty's wreck the dive site is crossing their resort and walking just 2 minutes. And the resort is the best too. Feelin homey there. See you for another dive :)
Joe's Diving Bali - Dive Castle - Tauchburg,Excellent quality for the price!,09/01/2021,"I went diving around Tulamben with my friend on this early September. While my friend was taking the open water dive certification, I accompanied him and went to stay on this place. Friska and Martin were also very nice! not to mention I really love their dogs Niki & Lucky. I love the place, the view, the castle-like architecture concept, and the pools! with the affordable price, I got all the necessary facilities like an air conditioner, hot water, breakfast, etc. The only thing that can be improved in my opinion I think that it would be better if they have a bidet/water gun near the closet. Coz we Asians definitely need bidets! lol. But the overall experience was excellent! 5 out 5!"
Joe's Diving Bali - Dive Castle - Tauchburg,Get my open water (OW) certification at this amazing place,08/01/2021,"It’s really such a superb and amazing experience with Martin & Ka Friska. They’re really really kind and helpful. I came here first to try Discover Scuba Diving and a year later I’m enjoying my time here during taking my SSI open water. Everything about this place makes me feel comfortable, the resort is very huge and beautiful plus the course is very fun! Highly recommend to everyone and will definitely come back again to Joe’s 👍🏻"
Joe's Diving Bali - Dive Castle - Tauchburg,This Looks Like A Something I Can't Afford and Had Amazing Dives,08/01/2021,"I contacted them in the last minute of my trip and got a very fast response. All ini all, the whole place is very unique and I really love the tower where you can see the Agung Volcano and around. My room was spacious, clean, comfortable, and everything ran well. The room also has many sockets so it really helps for those who bring camera and other electrical stuff. If I could suggest anything, it would be the toilet and front door lock. Even though it wasn't very big deal, I personally like to have a bidet on the closet. I also think that it would be better to have some lock key for the front door (they provide safe box though and during my stay I felt very safe). What's even better is that you will be accompanied by very good dogs, Lucky and Wiky. However, the highlight from…"

I can stay in the room whole day to chill and just relax while working ❤The place was close to main attractions. Such beach or beachclubs. And it is a very peacefull place to stay. They also have a mini cafe which the food was SUPER DELICIOUS! Overall I recommend everyone to stay here for any occasion. Surely I will stay herw again one day!

Aeera Villa,Cute homey space,10/01/2021,"the loft was really cute and homey. we really liked that the bed was upstairs and it was very comfy. And it was a really good size as well. We had really good sleep ins. However, the tv was a bit far distanced from the bed - if the tv was bigger it would've been better because it was quite far that it was hard to read subtitles. Some amenities was missing and we had to call and ask for some like - no tea, beach towels, sponge and washing fluid for dishwashing. The public pool and the sofa in the living room was quite dirty, sofa had marks on it so we had to cover with beach towels to sit to be on the safe side. Other than that, the staff was super friendly and warm which made the stay feel more at home."

Mick's Place Bali,"Amazing place, remarkable ocean view and great stay.",08/01/2021,"Amazing stay in Mick's Place. We booked the Treehouse Bungalow and it was lovely bungalow with huge yard and spacious area. View of the hotel was amazing as we can see the unobstructed ocean view from the pool area. The hotel has direct and private access to the beach so it was great if you want to swim or surf at the beach. Breakfast was also good and it was served at the pool area so we can really enjoy the view. Check in process was also simple and easy. As we came a bit late, Sascha and Mick had arranged a security guard to assist us for checking in. They were a lovely and helpful couple, just amazed how they can managed the property from many years ago where nothing was built around the area. Will stay again and try honeymoon bungalow as they said it is the best seller…"

We had a relaxing foot massage in splendid spa, near the pool. The room was, as we expected, amazing. With huge bath and cozy bed, beautiful garden view. Also, we were lucky to get the discount for our room, because of the season. We ordered the floating breakfast and a floral bath - and had an incredible romantic holiday. We definitely will be back and hope to see all the staff and Ms. Suka again! Thank you one more time!"

Pros: + Our sunrise villa was huge and the sunrise was very beautiful. + Helpful staff despite the difficult situation. + Very spacious bedroom, bathroom, and lounge area beside your very own private pool, also with outdoor bathtub that didn't lack privacy. + No buffet, but a la carte breakfast was good complete with fruit, juices, toast everyday. We also got floating breakfast. + We were on our honeymoon so we liked the quietness. Cons: - It's at the very end of small streets, a bit hidden from the main road and gets dark at night. I wouldn't want to ride motorcycle by myself at night. I don't recommend staying here if you go out a lot. - They cut back on…"

Moving on, few days before our arrival, I received an e-mail from The Ritz-Carlton Bali mainly asked about my inquiries for our stay.

The Ritz-Carlton Bali,A nice day out at Ritz-Carlton Hotel,09/01/2021,"It was a beautiful day in Ritz-Carlton when I decided to go to a fish pond in the hotel, I called in for a buggy service and there I met the friendliest kak Regi, we shared a few stories and he even helped me took a photo near the pond.

The Ritz-Carlton Bali,"Best WFB, Happy Belly Happy Life",08/01/2021,"Continual extended restrictions (PPKM) in Jkt made me think it was time to explore a WFB (Work from Bali) life. My best friend & I made a short visit at Ritz soon after we reached the airport. The front desk staff, Ms. Mega & later Ms. Mei, did a great job to persuade us, offering an upgrade to Ritz Suite for a special offer. We first bought a 4 night stay but then extending our stay for another 2 nights coz the kitchen team spoiled us with their great fb, service, warm smiles & jokes. The room itself, we love the smart toilet, room layout & extra space to maintain our sanity. Curtain is also the best, total blackout. The beach & garden are well maintained. The Chef Director, Mr. Raymond Siek, assisted by Chef Kojong, are the best duet ever to keep the kitchen busy with food…"
The Ritz-Carlton Bali,Refreshingly fun family activities but inconsistent service,08/01/2021,"In 2018, we stayed at this Ritz property as a family of 4 and loved it.

Here's how we feel about our most recent stay: Pros: - beautiful sea breeze - pool right by the beach - fun family activities if willing to pay (prices are quite reasonable for these) - activities include beach side bbq, s'mores bonfire, kids pizza making with cocktails for the parents, and a free photoshoot with 1 free printed picture [you can pay a fee to receive more pictures or the digital copies] - comfortable cabanas by the pool - walkable, pretty grounds - a spacious, well equipped Kids Club perfect for children 4 years and up Cons: - we had several instances of insincere / bad service.…"

The Ritz-Carlton Bali,The Best 5 Star Hotel in Bali.,08/01/2021,"Having visited so many luxury 5-Star hotels in the world, I would say that my stay with The Ritz-Carlton Bali was an eye-opener, simply the best! The Ritz-Carlton Bali, although it has somewhat slightly outdated (but still amazing!) hard products compared to the other brands in the Nusa Dua vicinity, it has so many - perhaps all of the staff are exemplary! They are the ones who made my stay memorable and delightful. The staff is impeccably groomed, well-spoken, attentive, and intuitive. Allow me to express my earnest thanks to Mario (Front Desk Agent), Isa Dewi (Front Desk Agent), Chef Made, and Ms. Desi (Beach Grill). Hard product-wise, the hotel vicinity, and the room are squeaky clean and well-maintained. The pool is always spotless. Food and beverages were delicious in…"
The Ritz-Carlton Bali,Ritz Carton Bali Experience,08/01/2021,"Amazing stay! Super delicious breakfast and excellent breakfast setting. Beach front all you can “order” ala carte breakfast.

This will be my favourite stay option in Bali for a long time to come!!"
Maya Sanur Resort & Spa,A beautiful beachfront resort,10/01/2021,"We had a wonderful stay at Maya Sanur! Our room (Heavenly Ocean View Pool Suite) was really spacious and had a stylish, luxurious design. We absolutely loved the sunrise view over the ocean from our private pool. The food options at the resort are also great. We especially loved having lunch at the Tree Bar and we had an unforgettable romantic dinner at the Green Roof 360. You can also join different complimentary activities (like yoga) or just relax at one of the different pools. We also had a very relaxing treatment at their spa. All the staff at the resort was very friendly and welcoming during our whole stay. We would stay here again anytime!"
Maya Sanur Resort & Spa,Magnificent resort and best spa service,10/01/2021,"Maya Sanur Resort and spa located near sanur beach. It has access to Watu Jimbar beach. The concept is different with Maya Ubud. Meanwhile Maya Ubud already villas, Maya Sanur still use hotel room concept. .At the entrance, security check our body temperature and direct us to go to drop off. The drop off located at G floor and there are some staff who helping us to take our luggage and bring our luggage to lobby floor. Car parking located under the drop off and seems it still not busy so I got park at near lift. For lobby interior, I think its need to be renovated because seems spooky, and dark colour domination, but when you see the lagoon, the rooms, and the pool, its very beautiful. Maya Sanur have many photogenic photospots. Check in process needs approximately 15 minutes.…"
Maya Sanur Resort & Spa,Great ambience with great hospitality,10/01/2021,"I can proudly say that I have stayed in many, many hotels in Bali, but this hotel has the best hospitality. We only here for a short time, 3 days and 2 nights. So first day breakfast was ala carte, but the next day they turn it into buffet because I think there are increases of guests. My sister love the mie goreng so much (literally the best mie goreng we’ve ever had), she was so sad that she can’t find it in the buffet. We asked the staff if we can order it off menu, and yes they made it for us! The smallest details like how the staff remember our names are very pleasant. Room was cozy, we had our lagoon so we can freely swim any time. And they have mountain bikes, so my father can use it to ride all over Sanur. If there’s anything I disliked, it was the ants on the breakfast…"

Movenpick Resort & Spa Jimbaran Bali,Big hotel with big pools,09/01/2021,"Stayed for 1 night at Classic Room. Room was great, clean and well maintained. Service is also great. However, the hotel was quite crowded when we stayed there. Many kids were running and playing around in the lobby. They provided chocolate hours every 4-5pm -‘d it was complimentary which was nice. The pool is also huge and nice. We might be back but when the hotel is not crowded and full with kids"
Movenpick Resort & Spa Jimbaran Bali,its great place for family,09/01/2021,"they have everything to keep your kids happy. couldn't ask for more. its too bad we only got to experience 1 hour only in kids club. otherwise perfect stay. we will be back. I stayed during the covid period, but the hotel maintain to keep the essential operated such as slide for the kids, kids water play area. I stayed other hotels, it seems they open but everything is not operated."
Movenpick Resort & Spa Jimbaran Bali,luar biasa sekali buat saya,08/01/2021,"Nyaris tidak ada sesuatu pun yang di bawah expektasi saya, kecuali saat saya masih tinggal di kamar 1146, AC tidak berfungsi sebagaimana mestinya sehingga kamar terasa panas bahkan saat malam sekalipun. Untungnya keluhan saya direspon dengan sangat baik dengan memindahkan saya ke kamar yang lainnya."
Movenpick Resort & Spa Jimbaran Bali,Disappointing Accor experience,08/01/2021,"Modern hotel with its own shopping complex however my experience at the hotel was a bit disappointing. This was the only Accor Hotel in Bali during my PPKM stay that failed to recognise Accor membership and did not give an upgrade despite hotel relatively empty. My other stays at Pullman, Novotel, Sofitel all did. Movenpick also did not have the promotion available as advertised on the Accor website. Jimbaran Beach access was also closed. During the day of my checkout, I got a call around 10:45 to remind me to checkout, which seemed to be rushing their guests. As a regular Accor guest probably will not return to this particular hotel."
Movenpick Resort & Spa Jimbaran Bali,Rekomendasi Hotel daerah Jimbaran,08/01/2021,"Rekomendasi hotel di daerah Jimbaran Bali. Lokasinya dekat dengan tempat wisata daerah Jimbaran, salah satunya GWK.

There were also YELLOW AND BROWN STAINS EVERYWHERE on the bed sheet, pillows, and towels (REALLY NASTY!!!!). The floor was oily the whole time, I'm not sure if they really cleaned it because there were black spot on the floor and the next day when we were asking them to clean our room it was still there. And the worst thing was the security. on our 2nd day, We were back at the hotel at night around 11pm, and our room weren't locked! The housekeeper forgot to locked our room as the keys were still hanging. OMG. The bathroom seems aged, the shower temperature also took forever to warm up, and there were stains in the bathup as well, and the bowel area smells like sewer sometimes.…"

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Nothing special,10/01/2021,"Sofitel bali used to be our fav hotel but we were dissapointed from our last stay.

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Nice.. but..,10/01/2021,"Pengalaman menginap kami 3H2N di sofitel kali ini cukup mengecewakan, mungkin karena di awal check in staff reception melihat outfit from top to toe dan terlihat sama saya, yes, saya menggunakan outfit seadanya pada waktu check in tapi saya rasa bukan hospitality seperti itu yang harus tamu dapat pada awal menginap and it’s not proper right? Receptionist merupakan wajah awal hospitality dari sebuah hotel.. please do smile and proper greetings seperti yang kalian biasa lakukan sebelum pandemi.. Dan untuk prokes pada waktu breakfast tolong lebi diperketat, krn kami masi lihat staff tidak mengingatkan tamu yg tidak menggunakan masker pd waktu breakfast.. Sofitel dulu masuk dalam top list hotel di Bali untuk kami, semoga bisa bisa improve ke depannya khususnya bagian…"

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Worst Experiences,09/01/2021,Stayed here with my partner and hope to a relaxing time and be able to enjoy the room and all the facilities they offer. Everything is fine until we’re back from swimming at 6 noon and found not so small ant hanging around our table and floor. In a wet state after swimming we contacted the hotel staff and explain about everything. We didn’t bring food and haven’t ordered food but the ants keep coming and coming until there are so many. We waited almost half an hour and nothing. We contacted the operator again to req for room move and had to wait almost another half an hour for someone to come to our room and check the ants. My partner decided to go to the reception with the staff to ask for room move and had to wait almost an hour for someone to come to our room to help move…
Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Wisata,10/01/2021,"Good service,good food , good facilities. Very generous and the staffs are friendly. Love the ambience and cleanliness is the winning point. Thanks for your hospitality hopefully we can visit Sofitel in the future."
Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Below our expectation...,09/01/2021,"Upon our arrival, we were not getting a warm welcome. The front desk staff didn’t greet us with smile, the check in process was also longer than we expected. After finally checking in our room, we notice that there’s no body lotion in the bathroom. We called the guest service and they said it was provided by request, so we ordered one. After 2 hours, noone showed up to deliver it. We called again and wait. But we didn’t get it until we checked out. The slipper that is provided in room also too thin and poor quality. The breakfast was just okay, not a special one. We tried SoSpa, it was great and meet our expectation. Overall, we were not really happy with our stay and with 190 usd per night, there are many hotels in Bali which can offer better facilities and service (even…"
Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Great service,09/01/2021,This hotel has one of the most attentive services. The bell boys are quick to help their guests with their luggages and also with food delivery from the lobby to guest rooms. The breakfast team is very helpful with guests requests and they use Covid protocols in serving breakfast. My villa’s decoration was nice and the whole stay was very comfortable. Definitely will visit again!
Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Menginap di Sofitel yang sangat nyaman,09/01/2021,"Sebelum memberikan ulasan sy sampaikan dulu lokasi Sofitel Hotel di Nusa Dua, Bali terletak di BTDC dengan akses ke pantai yang tenang dan bagus. Kami menginap di Luxury Room nomor 6222 & 6223. Pelayanannya mengikuti protokol Covid, yaitu sebelum masuk harus cek suhu terlebih dahulu dan staf-staf hotelnya sangat baik dan ramah. Kamarnya pun luar biasa, berukuran sekitar 48m2, sangat bersih dan bed-nya sangat empuk. Enak banget tidurnya! Fasilitasnya yang dibuka antara lain : - Komalm Renang - Sepeda - Makan Itali/Romantic Dinner: Cuccina - BBQ: Toya - Aktivitas Outdoor: ada badminton, archery Pada malam terakhir kami makan malam ala BBQ di Toya, makanan enak dan harganya sukup bersahabat untuk kami ber 4.

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Sept 2021,09/01/2021,"Hygiene, architecture, activities provided are 5/5. However, Just sharing my latest experience with Sofitel pre PPKM/Indonesian lockdown and post-PPKM/ Indonesian lockdown - Customer service can be improved and should always be a priority despite the sudden increase in customers."
Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Good stay! Would totally recommend!,09/01/2021,"We stayed 3 nights in Sept 2021. Everything was great. Check-in was punctual. The check-in time is 3PM. We arrived at 2.30 and got our room at 3PM (absolutely no delay like many reviewers said). Every staff we met was very nice and accommodating. The room was clean and tidy. We found no issue with our room except for the broken sprinkle in the toilet. We asked for it to be fixed but no one came. We were only a bit bothered by it and too lazy to follow up so we just let it be. The AC was sooo cold - we love it. Hate staying in a hotel with AC that’s not functioning well and the AC in Sofitels worked really well (love it!). The staffs at breakfast was so nice. The foods were great. So many varieties! The first morning, the bfast was served ala carte style but the second morning…"

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,BEST PLACE TO RELAX,08/01/2021,I stayed at the Sofitel on 3-7 August 2021 and 12-15 August 2021. We were very happy to stay there. Very good services. Very friendly staffs. Even our room was upgraded to a villa. That's why we came back to stay there on 12-15 August. A lot of activity we can enjoy here. The staff at activity station is the best. He let us keep the bicycles at villa for 1 night. Because not a lot of people use it. I will come back to stay here
Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Memorable wedding Anniversary!!!,08/01/2021,"Our stay started with confusion due to the room arrangements, we booked suite, however we didn’t know that it was on a higher floor.

The Manager there who would wants to make sure we have such a great weekend, Mr Eduardo upgrade our booking to the Villa, thank you!

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Pertama kali menginap dan tidak akan kembali,08/01/2021,"Kami memesan kamar untuk dua malam termasuk sarapan pagi. Pros: - Staf yang berada di depan lobby ramah dan sangat membantu. Terima kasih kepada Artana, Yoda dan Angga. - Staf wanita yang menyajikan minuman juga ramah. - Kamar nyaman dan cukup besar. Kami mendapatkan 'sedikit' pemandangan laut dari balkon. Saya katakan sedikit karena pemandangan laut nya tertutup oleh bangunan di antara kamar hotel dan pantai. - Pantai bersih dan indah. Cons: - Air dari shower selalu membasahi lantai di depan pintu shower yang mengakibatkan lantai licin. - Siang hari elevator hanya satu yang difungsikan. Malam hari seluruh elevator tidak berfungsi. Suasana menuju kamar hotel gelap. Kami harus berjalan dan naik tangga manual saat kembali dari luar hotel. - Kamar tidak kedap suara. Kami…"

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Loving the beach and free bicycling rental,08/01/2021,"We were pleased to be upgraded to the 1 bedroom pool villa. Was spacious and really good air conditioning as in the afternoon, the villa is superbly hot,l. The villas are mostly glass door with glaring sun shine into the villa giving green house effect. So the ac units placed are perfect for cooling system! However, structurally the villa we stayed in had no privacy at all. The higher building rooms across our villa could look into our bathroom and outdoor shower. Though that entire building was closed (only partial rooms and villas are operating), something needs to be done for future full operation of the hotel Some part of the garden inside the villa near the bathroom window, needs lots of tender loving care We aren’t sure if the vast majority of the staffs were trainees…"

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Just a review for the hotel reservation team,08/01/2021,"Haven't got the chance to stay due to the worsening condition from COVID which came with strict movement restriction so this is purely a review for my engagement with the hotel reservation team. Originally booked for 2 nights. Then came the travel restrictions. Asked the hotel for reschedule arrangement pending the government update on the restrictions. Strike 1: asked by the hotel to provide the replacement booking date within 24 hours from my request. I came back saying if they have government planning on the restriction or if they know how COVID will progress, then let me know so I can make the decision. They later gave me 5 days to think about which was appreciated. Then after 5 days, the situation still not improving as much to have less restriction. I asked for…"

Karma Kandara,AMAZING INFINITY POOL IN THE EDGE OF BALI ISLAND!!,10/01/2021,"I've been to Karma Kandara for several times and no single experience fails me a bit. My latest stay was at 1-3th Oct 2021 at their suite, the lowest room category in the resort. But, the room itself meets my expectations. It was quite big with mini pantry, dining room and also living room in it. The resort has it's dedicated beach area called Karma Beach. You have to go down by their private elevator. It's kind of unique experience as you were given the lushly view of the ocean during going down to the beach where also happened to be breakfast area. You can also enjoy complimentary water sports with lifeguard to assist you. The cream on top is their infinity pool. With their famous ""K"" sign overlooking directly to the ocean makes you lost somewhere. The staff were nice,…"
Karma Kandara,"Almost perfect, but this one waiter ruin it",09/01/2021,"I was stay 23-26 Sep 2021. All is well, until a waiter name Hendra and his friend, overtake the line of elevator from us to go up from the beach. Wr have waited first in the line. He make the excuses that he bring food. Its terrible to overtake the line from guests like that."

The Astari - Villa and Residence,Menginap di Astari adalah pengalaman yang tak terlupakan.,03/01/2014,Ini adalah pertama kalinya saya menginap di sebuah vila di Bali. Saya kagum karena kamarnya begitu terawat dengan baik dan membuat saya terkesan dan menikmati sebagian besar tempat tidur yang sangat nyaman! Sangat menyenangkan menginap di vila ini. Kamar mandi luar ruangan?? Mengagumkan...Saya merasa seperti tinggal di alam terbuka. Layanannya bagus dan stafnya ramah dan mau membantu. Kolam renangnya sedikit kecil di vila tapi kolam renang utamanya jauh lebih besar dan bagus untuk bersantai. Bersiaplah saat hujan karena vila memiliki kamar mandi luar ruangan (sedikit basah =D). Makanannya enak dan Anda HARUS mencoba sosisnya.
The Astari - Villa and Residence,Layanan bagus dan kamar bersih.,03/01/2014,"Kamar hotelnya sangat bersih dan nyaman. Stafnya selalu bersedia membantu dan sarapannya dibawakan ke kamar Anda dengan sentuhan yang cantik. Kolam renangnya hanya beberapa kaki dari kamar Anda, dan ini menyenangkan! Saya menyampaikan keluhan yang sama seperti orang sebelumnya tentang musik di sekitar kolam renang. Namun, pilihan musik yang buruk dan volumenya hanya berlangsung satu pagi saat saya berada di sana. Selebihnya saya merasakan pengalaman yang sangat tenang dan menenangkan di tepi kolam. Saya juga yakin jika Anda meminta petugas di meja depan untuk mematikan atau mengecilkan musiknya, mereka akan bersedia melakukannya karena mereka selalu ingin membuat masa menginap Anda menyenangkan. Cukup berjalan kaki sebentar dari pantai Jimbaran dan kebanyakan restoran ke hotel…"
The Astari - Villa and Residence,Astari hotel yang nyaman dengan harga terjangkau,03/01/2014,"Kesan pertama saat kami berdua menginap di Astari sungguh luar biasa, melampaui harapan kami. Astari menyediakan atmosfir yang nyaman untuk bersantai, jauh dari keramaian. Kami menikmati liburan kami untuk menikmati ulang tahun pernikahan kami di Bali. Kolam renangnya umumnya besar dan kami dapat menggunakannya setiap saat. Astari memiliki 14 kamar yang dibagi menjadi 2 lantai. Kebetulan kamar kami di lantai pertama, istri saya benar-benar menyukai kamar kami karena langsung menghadap ke kolam renang. Udara sekitar di Astari jauh dari polusi dan kemacetan (Kuta penuh dengan kemacetan di mana pun). kami mendapatkan sarapan di pagi hari sesuai dengan apa yang kami inginkan. Saat memesan makanan untuk makan siang kami, kami makan dalam kamar. Astari menyediakan makanan yang…"
The Astari - Villa and Residence,Tempat untuk bersantai dan menyegarkan pikiran anda,03/01/2014,"Ukuran kamarnya lebih besar daripada sebagian besar hotel baru di Bali. Sangat terjangkau dari segi harga untuk ukuran kamar demikian. Udaranya sangat segar di pagi dan malam hari. Jauh dari keramaian dan atmosfernya sangat santai dan damai. Cara yang baik untuk menghabiskan waktu menyegarkan pikiran. Tempatnya 15 menit jalan kaki untuk ke pantai. Tetapi, mereka juga menyediakan transportasi gratis untuk mengantar anda. Transportasi gratis dengan perjanjian untuk ke Kuta dan Nusa Dua. Karyawannya ramah dan melayani. Sangat membantu dalam memberikan informasi atau mencarikan taksi. Hal terbaik yang harus dinikmati adalah kamar tidur dan kolam renangnya. Sangat berprivasi!! Terima kasih Astari"

Andaz Bali,Beautiful Resort,10/01/2021,"Loved the main pool, nice for sunbathing. Nice, helpful and polite staffs. Breakfast was a feast. My cappuccino was perfect. Room was spacious, nice lighting, clean. The whole resort is very clean, no single speck of dust. Loved the whole architecture and design of the resort."
Andaz Bali,One of the best hotels in Bali for the range,10/01/2021,"Everything was excellent from room size, design to the quality of F&B, particularly the breakfast. Ambience and service was also brilliant - staff go out of their way to help. The only minor annoyance is that the fitness center is in the Hyatt next door and with pre-booking required and limited capacity, its a hassle. Still, I prefer the Andaz over the Hyatt Regency next door."
Andaz Bali,Liburan bersama teman teman,10/01/2021,"Enjoy banget dengan Andaz, di belakang hotel ada pantai dan ada jalan jogging track, lumayan hampir 3 km, pulang pergi bisa 6 km, belum kamar di Andaz sangat cozy.. enak banget, toiletnya keren, seperti di Japan, sungguh pengalaman yg menyenangkan"
Andaz Bali,A hotel with the beach front and the breakfast ambience is very nice with semi open 3 restaurants linked to each other.,10/01/2021,"Pandemic gives limitations in many areas, even so Andaz can make my stay very relaxing and pleasant.

Andaz Bali,New fresh and clean hotel,10/01/2021,Really love the design and clean room and we can really relax and enjoy there with family👍. So much fun and sweet memories for staying at Andaz sanur. Hope can go back there with big family and friends when the pandemic is over.
Andaz Bali,VERY VERY SATISFIED,10/01/2021,"Beyond my expectations, really love the vibes and the hotel also very clean, they even do double cleaning in the morning and before bed. Big room, i stayed at lagoon suite. The staff are super helpful, kind, and thoughtful. They even followed us to the beach with towels without we asked them for that. Super easy to connect with the staff via whatsapp ( super fast responds!! ). Ala carte bfast which i like and they served ramyun for bfast. Who does that? Only in andaz i guess.

Staff was very attentive, they were quick on their service, everything was catered for with smile on their face. The kids club here is amazing! They have everything and Ms Putu was very kind. I only hoped that they have more information on thekr website as it is difficult to check what facilities they have, what is included with the room etc. I was surprised that my room did not inclide breakfast as during booking it was not specified. However we ended up purchasing breakfast on top and it was superb! Breakfast staff was very attentive as well. Basically everything exceeded our expectation. I was most impressed with our suite, we stayed in the…"
Andaz Bali,Newest Attraction in Sanur,08/01/2021,"This was my my second visit to this amazing property. First one was a month ago I went to Andaz to check this new hotel. I went to the deli for some wine and was served by someone named Heri he was very courteous and not long after a chef came by to greet us and explained a bit about their products (sorry I forgot your name :(). For the second visit I came by to try their Breakfast and was greeted by Jesisca, she elaborately explained the menu and recommended some dishes which now I’m craving for! Our table later on is taken care by Mona which i think she is the jewel of Wok Wok. She could carry a genuine pleasant conversation and she came by to our table from time to time to make sure that our needs are fulfilled. During my breakfast I also met Heri and surprisingly he…"

Andaz Bali,Great place to chill,08/01/2021,"Today, i visited a recently built resort called Andaz Hotel in Sanur. The moment you are in the hotel you are greeted by a really nice lobby, a lot of green and a lot of wood with simple cut outs, the overall architecture of Andaz is really nice, also makes a good spot for taking photos. Also big thanks to one of the staff there named Ms. Yunik for showing me the around the place and the other very friendly staff. Moving on the food was great most notably the interesting chefs greeting, it was a black rice cracker with sauce that consist of mayo, yuzu and spices. Even with my short stay at that place and bad timing (raining) i enjoyed every bit of it, overall rate that place a 5/5 would go there again."
Andaz Bali,Amazing service!,08/01/2021,"I came here with my family for breakfast at Wok Wok and the wait staffs warmly welcomed us and were incredibly respectful. Mona was very knowledgeable with the menu and gave us great recommendations for breakfast. We had a fun time trying out varieties of food through Mona. Heri came and refilled our drinks and made sure everything was taken care of and made sure our orders came through. Jesisca also came and explained to us the different meals in the menu and started us off with our breakfast. All of them were extremely kind! Great food and hospitality from all of them, and my family and I will come back here for sure!"

Pullman Bali Legian Beach,Need maintenance but excellent services!,10/01/2021,"Yes it is an old hotel and it has some wear/tear. However, when staying at a hotel, services are one of the most important aspect and Pullman Legian managed to deliver the excellent services despite the difficult situation. 1) Reception and check-in I was in a really bad mood when I came due to my bad experiences at the previous place where I was staying in Jimbaran. However, the warm welcome from Ms. Eni and her team managed to fix my mood. I also did not expect the premium suite upgrade which I truly appreciate. 2) Room I stayed in room 3402 which is a bit far from the elevator. This premium suite is nice with a great garden view from different directions and the separated living space also useful for me when I'm doing my remote work. The room interior kind of need a bit of…"

Pullman Bali Legian Beach,Happy ! Good value for money,10/01/2021,"Stayed 5 nights With the price of Average rp700k per night incl breakfast we are very happy especially with the very good breakfast here. We were upgraded to grand deluxe room, but the room although spacious with nice balcony and large bathroom and closets but old with very small TV with rather blurry pictures, not up to the 5star hotel standard, floor was dusty upon our check in so need to wear room slipper. Room sound proof also not really good. But well considering the price, breakfast, location, hospitality , easy parking, and beautiful gardens for us the stay was still good value."
Pullman Bali Legian Beach,Short but fabulous stay,09/01/2021,"After a bad experience at another hotel we decided to spend our last night at the Pullman. We checked in early but as the room wasn't quite ready we sat by the pool enjoying a relaxing coffee. On going to our room we had been upgraded to a suite which made my day after the previous night and a big thank you to Arya, Hari & Dodi for arranging this. The suite was spacious and tastefully furnished and meticulously clean. Dinner was at the Deli restaurant where you can sit inside or if you prefer outside by the gardens and pool. Although the menu is limited it has a selection of local and western foods so something for everyone and our meal was thoroughly enjoyed. Breakfast was again at the Deli restaurant which is an inverted buffet (you choose and they serve it) and again a…"
Pullman Bali Legian Beach,"Steal our Money, Poor, feeble, and Shoddy",10/01/2021,"We initially plan to stay 4 nights into this 5 stars mediocore hotel. Slow check in process, and we got free upgrade room. But, with the vile and feeble room. We moved to Suite room, which is claimed as their super fantastic room. We agree to add the charge and move to their Suite. But, the aircon was leak and you got mosquito bites as bonus during your sleep. We choose to move to another hotel in the second day. They agree to refund all our money, and promise to charge one night only! And voila, they charge more without our authorisation. The reception also have terrible attitude, giving us checkout bill without envelope and no explanation about extra charge. We ask the details and she said that's HER MANAGER fault! OMG!!!!! Is it really 5 star hotel? Is it Pullman Standart? …"

They also explain the brekfast situation and special offers (which was great for an Accor member). They only open one tower since there are major renovation going on on the other two towers (can't wait!). Although some of special kits they used to have on the room are nowhere to be found (such as umbrella and beach bag), the room situation is still as great as the first time they open the Hotel back then. Definitely will come back again and again. props for the management!"

Nirjhara,Therapeutic stay with waterfall and luscious jungle surrounding,10/01/2021,"The perfect place for those who are seeking serenity and time to spend in the hotel. The establishment is beyond beautiful. So far, they are the only one who let the guess choose the scent of the amenities. Swimming Pool is actually the best, with controlled temperature, overlooking the famous waterfall, and low level of Calcium hypochlorite. Gym is 24/7 which again, first time having this. They also have private cinema that you can also book :) nice touch. However, most of the in house activities happened on Weekend, so during our stay, there wasnt much going on. Few stuff that this hotel could improve: the quality of the toilet - the bidet was quite painful. Also, a bit disappointed with their 1-ply toilet tissue and the maintenance of the balcony. We stayed at 1 Br river…"
Nirjhara,A room with waterfall view and private cinema!!,08/01/2021,"It's a common thing if a hotel provides ocean or pool view, but how about waterfall view? Welcome to Nirjhara! Nirjhara itself means waterfall in Sanskrit. The main pool, restaurant, and some rooms overlook the waterfall. I suggest you to stay at Canopy Suite number 37 where you can have waterfall view next to your bed. The Canopy suite consists of 2 level. The private roof deck at the second level is very huge with bathtub. You can see sunset from there. The price of the FnB is also affordable. Another cream on top is their private mini cinema with many film selections."
Nirjhara,Quaint villas,08/01/2021,"It was such therapeutic and rejuvenated stay for us. Surrounded by nature, waterfall, simply breathtaking view! Definitely a place to go for those needing tons of serene atmosphere surrounded by nature We were so blessed to be upgraded to the river pool villa Service were impeccable! Very welcoming and attentive to the guests’ need So much privacy in the villa and completely zen atmosphere We were given toiletries choices!! This is perhaps the only hotels that offer 3 choices of fragrances The villas have free biking activities, guided and non guided. Worry not, the non guided one is really straightforward road and superbly easy to navigate. It is a must to take these sunset and sunrise bike tour! Highly recommended. The guide was very knowledgeable and fun to be with …"
Nirjhara,Perfeito para relaxar,08/01/2021,Fiquei um final de semana com meu namorado no Nirjhara e ficamos surpresos com toda estrutura e atenção da equipe. Perfeito para relaxar na piscina (ouvindo o barulho das cachoeiras ao redor) e a academia e sauna antes do café da manhã fizeram nosso dia perfeito. Super recomendo e voltaremos com certeza.
Novotel Bali Nusa Dua Hotel & Residences,DISAPPOINTING!,10/01/2021,I stayed for 2 nights in 2 bedroom apartment suites.the room supposed to be for 4 people but we were only 3 people.the breakfast was ala carte and the server rejected me when i wanted to add for more portion american style breakfast.they said i didnt want any main course before so they gave me more fruits.doesnt make any sense when its clearly there were only 3 of us in 1 room.when i asked to have the spa at 6.45 pm they rejected us without any solution.the housekeeping service wasnt 24 hours.i wanted to use the laundry service at around 11 pm but they said they didnt have any housekeeper left. I asked for a couple of bottled water at 7 am and they told me to wait until 8 am.the reason was because the housekeeper will come at 8. I mean didnt u have anymore employee like bellman…

Padma Ubud Retreat,Wonderful. Use my credit night carried forward.,10/01/2021,"I had a one night credit from my last stay on July (review previously). Needed to cut short my last holiday on July due to new PPKM rules, and without any hassle, Padma granted me the night I didnt use (but need to be under the same price bucket). Back on September to use it. Lovely. The front staffs - the team is different - but stayed as professional and friendly, I undertstood they are intern (?) Hats off the training manager to have all your staffs (even in the restaurant) and gardeners having such a polite and friendly attitude. Room is clean as expected. Couldnt ask for more."
Origin Uluwatu,Unwind in this tranquil surround.,09/01/2021,"The ease of booking was continued on arrival, with assistance of luggage taken to the well prepared and appointed tent. The garden setting made it easy to unwind and feel far removed from the daily grind of living in paradise. Inside our pool tent, the kitchen area relies on the use of room service or the open space seating of the restaurant and pool. The fridge purely for drinks. There was cold and hot water in apply supply for a Kintamani Bali coffee in a bag or a lovely hot cup of Twinnings Tea. The cooled bedroom space looks out over the pool for easy viewing as you watch the riparian entertainment of friends and family. The sofa doubles as an extra child bed, loaded with an array of colourful tribal and batik prints. The separate toilet, shower and bath add to the…"
Origin Uluwatu,Glamping Heaven,08/01/2021,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for about a month, and we absolutely loved it. The hotel itself is clean and quiet, with all of the amenities of a high-end hotel. The tents were comfortable with air-con, hot water and a smart tv. The beds are amazing. Each tent has it's own little dining space which was great, you feel like you have a little living room with a dining table to relax and eat meals. The bathroom is all outside, but covered so you get that amazing breeze while you brush your teeth or take a bath. They have the sweetest lounge area around the large communal pool with a fire pit. We spent several evenings out there just reading our books or watching the stars. The area around Origin isn't built up so it's very quiet and feels like you really are camping. But, the…"
Echoland,Not privacy,09/01/2021,"The rooms looks nice and clean, but what I didn't like about Echoland are the windows in the room. It doesn't give you privacy because the curtain is not good. The rooms windows are on the corridors of the hotel, which people can see you. Not very happy with the place."

GRÜN Canggu - Treehouse Lodging,A nice experience overall,08/01/2021,"The place is serene and peaceful. The design is so unique. The view is amazing. In my room, we have a mini kitchen set, refrigerator, refill drinking water, and bluetooth audio. I’m also pleased with the hospitality. They are so kind, helpful, and fast response. The location is a bit hard to find since the signpost is small. Also a bit distant from the crowd (central Canggu) with no places to eat around, but can for sure order delivery."
GRÜN Canggu - Treehouse Lodging,An Absolute Gem,08/01/2021,"Suasana di dalam rumah yang nyaman dengan view sawah yang indah membuat terasa betah berlama lama di Treehouse ini.

Potato Head Studios,Trailblazing,10/01/2021,"Great to see this amazing space back open. From the superlative service (not uncommon in Bali but extra attentive here...), idyllic setting, creative design and thoughtful touches throughout, this place is an experience. You just get a good feeling from entering this space and as you move throughout it. There are other places with a similar view, but these guys know how to frame it and add the soundtrack… The main pool area offers one of the best vantage points for sunset in the area. The Sunset Park deck is hard to beat for sundowners. The breakfast is one of the best I’ve had in the area. Even the drink selection is top notch. The ocean view puts it over the top. The rooms have thoughtful touches throughout, from the wooden cutlery and bamboo straws to use during your trip…"

We loved everything about it; from the moment we checked in we felt like part of the family. All the staff knew our names and provided a very personal, friendly but professional customer service. The facilities were fantastic; we loved exploring the library, the gym was very impressive and the room was chic and comfortable. We spent most of our 2 days by the pool, the waiting staff were attentive without being pushy and the selection on the pool food menu was amazing and surprisingly affordable. The cocktails were expertly made and the servers menu knowledge meant they knew exactly what to recommend to pair with the delicious oysters we ordered for sunset. We also massively appreicated and respected their…"
Potato Head Studios,Epic Stay At Desa Potato Head,09/01/2021,"Just finished a 2 night stay at beautiful Desa Potato Head. The rooms are so chic and the staff was the most professional in Bali (most remembered my name and food order by the 2nd day). Truly fantastic experience at the hotel and beach club and I spent much of my time exploring the library, spa, gym and rooftop of this beautiful resort. Next time, I’ll definitely extend my stay. Highly recommended."

Shout out to one of the staff who really gave me super services."
Potato Head Studios,2019 stay at potatohead!,09/01/2021,One of the best hotel in Bali. I actually stayed before the pandemic hits back in 2019. I experience the hotel during it’s crowded days. The dynamic is unique. The cultural programs they made is the difference that sets potatohead with the rest. The rooms are super nice! I enjoyed the room with the ocean view. Even the smaller ones are ber convenient! And The foods are delicious as well! Will definitely return again once it’s possible!

I would recommend this place to all my friends!!! We had an amazing time! Thank you Potatohead studios ❤️ I will be back!"
Potato Head Studios,Superb,09/01/2021,"One of the most amazing stays ever !! The studios are spacious and have everything to make you feel home from home with a view to die for and complemented by an extraordinary array of people that make you feel as if you have always lived there ! The restaurant Kaum serves food that you will never forget and breakfast by the pool looking at the waves of the ocean will make you dream of those moments for years! I'm quite demanding when it comes to service - but I could not fault anything - just as the title of this review says ""SUPERB"""
Potato Head Studios,Mrs. Upi,09/01/2021,"Welcome new concept hotel in Seminyak Bali, Potato Head Studio, everything touch is amazing, all staf very fiendly and very good service, thank you All team.....hope we can stay again next time, very recommended....."
Potato Head Studios,All about the good vibes...,08/01/2021,"By saying i only 'enjoyed my 2 night stay' would be an understatement. We had an ocean facing view and normally that alone elevates the room. However, for this instance the room matched the view. Hand in hand they worked with each other perfectly. Staying at a place is meant to take you away, its meant to stimulate the imagination as much as it stimulates relaxation. It did both for me. The space is wide and breezy, the staff are genuinely warm and authentic, nothing seemed like a hassle and everything seemed like a pleasure. The creativity, the design the little thoughtful touches is what separates itself from others. Its a total experience and i will be back."
Potato Head Studios,Beach front get away,08/01/2021,We had an amazing weekend stay with our 2 children. Check in we were given water bottles for us and our children which is an amazing touch . The rooms facing the ocean is so beatiful and warm adults loved the table that becomes a bar And the kids said it was the best bath they ever had . The breakfast is amaZing with right balance or western local cuisine. Chairs very uncomfortable for both adults kids. Which is a shame ! Pool had amazing kids section and kids activity was organized one day with arts and crafts . We had a great stay and would recommend with kids .
Potato Head Studios,All the little details,08/01/2021,"I think this is the nicest hotel I’ve ever stayed in - there is so much attention to detail in every (seemingly) little detail of the property, the room and the entire experience. I need to come back again to take it all in... we stayed in an ocean front room which was perfect for a couple, or with kids - very spacious and impeccable with loads of amenities and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. We are coming back for sure. Thank you"
Potato Head Studios,Favourite resort,08/01/2021,"I can’t speak highly enough of our stay at potatohead. From the moment we arrived we felt like we stepped into another world of relaxation and bliss. The team are so well trained, attentive and polite, I’ve never experienced such fantastic customer service. The room are gorgeous with every detail thought of to make our stay comfortable, from the mini bar to the extremely comfortable bed. Not to mention that everything is sustainable, they really nailed everything. The kids were kept busy, with yoga and art classes, they also got to experience a turtle release, something that I know they will remember for ever. Now to the delicious food! OMG we are big foodies in our family and the food was so epic ! Every dish we tried we were wowed by. Potatohead is famous for its cocktails…"
Potato Head Studios,Feels like home,08/01/2021,"Stayed for 2 nights in the desa studio. What i love most about my stay was the excellent service and the fact that they greet you with ""welcome home"". It does really feel like a home away from home. Everything about the stay was personal. The ocean front sea breeze wherever you go. The interior inside the room is very comforting and super inspired how they turn waste into beautifully designed items that are super functional at the same time. A must try is the KAUM menu at tanaman restaurant. Indonesian comfort food at its finest. Starting off the day with a morning meditation on the rooftop, followed by laps in the 50 m pool, breakfast, working in the libary, a gym workout, topping it off with one of the best massages I have ever had. This place has it all. Can't wait to…"
Potato Head Studios,Desa mazing,08/01/2021,"from arrival through to checkout every single detail, thought and action curated by the team at Potato Head Studios (and suppliers) is amazing! truly world class and the perfect place for family & friends to visit and stay. sustainability is not just a catch phrase for this 'village'. all elements resonate with a level of environmental awareness that is truly fantastic to see and experience; from recycled plastic notepads to sourcing only local produce. everything has been carefully thought through. kudos"
Potato Head Studios,The Perfect Holiday,08/01/2021,"The rooms were exceptional. The beds are so comfortable! The overall design and layout makes for a very comfortable stay.

One of the best holidays in a long time."
Potato Head Studios,Perfect Staycation,08/01/2021,"Thank you, Potato Head Studios for the best weekend I've had in a long time!

Nusa Veranda Sunset Villas & restaurant,10/10 Beautiful Hotel and Great Value!,09/01/2021,"Nusa veranda is a wonderful stay for families, friends, or couples seeking a romantic getaway. Clean, comfortable, and unbeatable views of sunset over the ocean! Every room (and we’ve stayed in 4 of them) has a view of the ocean. The aircon works well and there’s a thick comforter on the bed (a rare but essential combination in SE Asia— I always sleep like a baby!) It’s a family business run by Wayan and his sister, Ketut- genuinely lovely and honest people who will go out of their way to give you the best experience. A wonderful, relaxing getaway every time. Outstanding value. Stay here!"

The rooms are very clean and well-maintained, the staff very attentive and friendly. The place is quiet and the beds very comfortable. All tap water is salt water so travellers might need to get used to this. For us, it was no problem at all. We were travelling in a group and Wayan, the owner, let us access the kitchen and use all facilities like we belong to his family. We were very happy with our stay and will definitely come back again!"
Nusa Veranda Sunset Villas & restaurant,A nice sunset spot,09/01/2021,"The place is really amazing. The view on the open ocean (sunset), nusa Lembongan and the seaweed farms make it very special.

Bali Diamond Villas,Tempat yang Indah:),12/01/2017,"Saya menginap di sana sekitar tahun 2010. Saya sangat menyukai vilanya. Hanya saja, tak begitu banyak pilihan di situ. Pantainya sedikit kotor dan perlu supir untuk menuju tempat lain. Secara keseluruhan, pegalaman saya di sana sangatlah baik tapi itupun karena vila ataupun perjalanan saya ke luar. Tak banyak tempat untuk dikunjungi. Intinya, saya sungguh menyukai tempat ini. Para staf serta supirnya pun sangat baik hingga kami senang di sana. Saya tak tahu apakah mungkin untuk meninggalkan pesan untuk saya jika Anda ingin melihat foto-fotonya."

Paket menginap termasuk jasa pembantu lengkap, tukang kebun dan pemeliharaan kolam. Lokasinya sangat bagus, sekitar 20 menit berkendara menuju Sanur, Ubud, dan Candidesa. Pantainya cocok untuk berselancar namun kami lebih memilih untuk bersantai di vila. Restoran di tepi pantai menyediakan bir Bintang dan kami sering menikmati pemandangan ombak di sini. Saya pasti akan kembali lagi ke sini."

Mercure Kuta Bali,"Pandemic kills, and trainees being trainees.",10/01/2021,"I stayed here previously on 2017 and I had a great time, so I decided to book this hotel again for my trip with my dad.

Well there was a table, but it was occupied with complimentary drinks, at it has ANTS. Like, LOTS of ants. Funny enough, they ran out of insecticides, and used disinfectant instead 😂 Also the housekeepers seemed like don’t care to remove their shoes when entering our room (yes it happened many…"

This hotel is not like a normal hotels, this is a homy place. i feels like at my home. the room was very clean and tidy. especially the staff!! They have limited staff, i saw only 1 guy at the reception dan 1 girl that always help me to clean the room. but they are doing good. all the staff are the best ever.LOL... They gave me great service during my stay for 5 days... The small things that need to improve about this hotel is, the Hot Water. The Hot Water is not working for shower. but for me it's not a big deal. The important things when we stayed at the hotel is "" SERVICE "", and here they gave me great service. and this hotel very cheap. See you…"
Serela Legian Hotel,Hotel dan karyawan ramah,10/01/2021,"Sedih sekali melihat bali saat ini, dimana mana sepi sekali. Legian yang dulunya ramai sekarang jadi sepi. Saya bingung mencari hotel yang buka, karena sudah beberapa kali pesan hotel online, tapi sampainya di tempat hotel tersebut tutup. beruntung saya sempat melihat IG dan saya lihat promosi dari serela legian ini. Ternyata hotel ini benar benar masih buka dan hotelnya terjaga kebersihannya. Senang sekali menginap di hotel ini, serasa rumah sendiri karena tempatnya tenang dan nyaman. ditambah lagi dengan karyawan dan managernya yang ramah. jadi ingin lama lama disini. saya sangat merekomendasikan hotel ini. ngomong ngomong, saya dikasi free upgrade lho di suite room nya, mungkin karena sepi ya. oh iya, aku pesan hotel ini lewat agoda, harga nya murah."

Amatara Agung Raka,"Amazing staff, hidden gem in the heart of Ubud",09/01/2021,I stayed at Amatara Agung Raka for 3 months in one of their villas. my stay was amazing. the location was central and convenient and the staff went above and beyond to make my stay a memorable one. i will certainly stay there again while in Ubud and recommend this hotel to others. it's within a short drive to the yoga barn and popular restaurants.
Amatara Agung Raka,Hidden Gem in the Heart of Ubud,09/01/2021,Me and my partner stayed at this resort one night and we were amazed by the beauty inside this resort. The Balinese atmosphere is very thick and calming even though we are in the middle of the city. This resort made us feel as if we were away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Too bad we only booked for one night because we had a reservation at another hotel. We will come back when visiting Bali next year.
Amatara Agung Raka,Ubud Staycation!,08/01/2021,"Stayed 1 night at their 1 bedroom pool villa. The villa was spacious with open living room & kitchen. You can actually cook here as they provide stove on the kitchen. Bed was comfy, the pool was nice and the view from my room was beautiful. I tried their floating breakfast and it was good. The staff are all very attentive and kind. The location is superb! Close to a lot of cafes and Monkey Forest."
New Pondok Sara Villa,Rundown very disappointing,10/01/2021,I booked the two bedroom villa for four days and had to leave after two nights walking away as there is a no refund policy. The photos shown are many years old the villas are very run down and the breakfast is terrible only nasi goreng or noodles. Only two of the villas are open as the rest are abandoned with weeds and rubbish. Needs full renovation I paid $100 a night and it was way too much.
Ubud Wins Bungalow,"Очень чисто, супер завтрак.",08/01/2021,"Очень дружелюбный персонал. Очень очень недорого. У меня был номер на 2-м этаже, большой и чистый. Уборка каждый день. Смена полотенец раз в 2-3 или по запросу. Классный вид из окна. Но самое что поразило, за такую цену вы мало того что получите отличный сервис(чем не могут похвастаться некоторые дорогие отели) , но плюсом, если у вас включено- супер завтрак с большой порцией фруктового салата прям с утреннего рынка. Я готов вернуться только из-за одного завтрака!!!) Очень рекомендую."
Ubud Wins Bungalow,awesome place and superb friendly host,09/01/2021,"I am staying here with my husband forna quick escape from our routine.

I just cant believe its a budget bungalow since its deserved for lot better of it. Definetly will coke back to stay here again."
Semabu Hills Hotel,Exceed my expectation,10/01/2021,"Ok the hotel is not to be compared to a luxurious resorts typically found in Nusa Dua Bali, but hey this is the smaller more secluded island of Nusa Penida! One would expect a more natural and simple situations. But to my surprise the room is very comfortable and LARGE! Perfect for holiday with your family or friends. The bedding are super comfortable and air conditioner works fine. In the morning you will be greeted with the amazing view of the sea and mainland Bali (stunning view)!"

Munduk Menir Villas,Hidden Gems in Munduk,08/01/2021,"I can't find simple words to describe the beauty of this property and the people. First is they grow their vegetable and fruits so everything is fresh. The second is the infinity pool has an amazing view. The third is the villa, despite their lack of staff during the pandemic, is still in excellent condition from the maintenance and cleanliness and also the view from their balcony is breathtaking! Fourth is the food, I had this excellent Balinese roast chicken for dinner! And also their breakfast is amazing. Last but not least, the staff takes care of you and made feel like our home. Specifically, thanks to Eka who was with us from check-in till check out, and to Hendra the manager who made us feel like we are home. Thank you Munduk menir!"

Citadines Berawa Beach Bali,Don't forget to go to the rooftop bar!,10/01/2021,"First time visiting Citadines Berawa, the hotel is only a stone throw away to Berawa Beach, the building is hard to miss. Upon arrival they gave us coupons to enjoy welcome drink at the rooftop bar, and wow I love it! A bar and rooftop swimming pool with almost 360 degrees view! They have a latin dance event when I went there, and I think it is a regular program from the hotel. The room has a kitchenette which help us a lot when we want to cook or reheat our takeout food. It also provide a small refrigerator so our beers are always cold! AC is also cold, a necessity in hot and humid Bali. Going out to the balcony in the morning and sip a cup of hot tea is a plus (please ask for room with view to garden or the one not facing to neighbor) I love the rain shower, the water…"
Bayu Cottages Hotel and Restaurant,An Excellent Stay,10/01/2021,"An amazing small resort with beautiful views. Everything about this place is top class.

Linens and towels were definitely 5* something you do not normally get in a hotel of this size and price. There is a great little pool in front of the restaurant with the same views as the rest of the hotel.

The guy who helped orchestrate the dinner was named Darius and he was an amazing help, very giving of his time to answer any questions I had about planning the dinner. We as a group ordered the Babi Guling, and it was amazing. The staff was super friendly and set up a reserved table area near the front of the restaurant so we can have our own space + watch the sunset, as they brought out the Suckling Pig & cut it open right in front of us, as well as created a separate table of everything we need to create the Babi Guling, with rice, veggies, sambal, etc. The food was amazing & the service was awesome – one of my friends literally thanked me for inviting her for what she called…"

Kayumas Seminyak Resort,New and Fancy,10/01/2021,"Perfectly located In the heart of Seminyak, you can literally walk to the beach or any cafe / restaurant around! A quiet place to have a nice sleep but close enough to any famous spot in the area. The room are new, clean and air conditioner works great (which is really important when you’re in Bali). The staff are very nice and helpful that you can feel the Balinese hospitality. Though one thing they could improve is the morning coffee at breakfast. It taste a bit like instant coffee which was not expected from such a nice resort. Other than that everything was perfect. Definitely would recommend to stay!"

Rimbun Canggu Hotel,What a serenity,08/01/2021,"I thought this hotel would be different from their pic on the website, but actually it was real. Green garden, clean room, complete amenities and lovely modern room design. If you are coming for business, you may try this hotel. Lovely"
Sunrise Cottage,Good Value Beachfront view!,10/01/2021,"Sunrise cottage is among many beachfront villas at north nusa penida. But my choice goes to this hotel because it looks more well maintained compare to others (judging from the pictures online). it is located between west and east of nusa penida, so it is a good choice if you want to visit both side and spend 1 night at nusa penida. I got upper floor villa with beautiful sunrise beach views. my room is quite spacious, wooden flooring and wall, equipped with smart TV (youtube netflix etc), electric kettle, small fridge and hairdryer. Bedroom is clean, however, it lacks lighting and get really dark at evening. internet is unstable and unreliable (this is the issues due to lack internet infrastructure in the island, so its understandable) The bathroom is spacious with marble…"
Bugan Villas,Settingan yan bagus tetapi masih ada yang kurang,11/01/2016,"Kami memesan Bugan Villa sebagai awal dari masa bulan madu kami (3 hari dan malam untuk waktu bersantai kami setelah pesta pernikahan kami) dan villa nya benar-benar bagus. Walau mereka sedang dalam proses renovasi tetapi tidak terdengar bunyi nya dari jalan atau dari jalan depan villa sampai di hari kami check out. Kamarnya bersih dan rapi dan stafnya sangat menolong ketika anda bertanya untuk meminta bantuan meski mereka tak terlihat di mana-mana, mungkin mereka ingin memberi anda privasi. Tarifnya termasuk sarapan tapi agak mengecewakan misalnya telur yang disajikan dingintap bukan masalah bagi kami karena kami tidak rakus dalam hal makan. Tarif villla nay masuk akal tapi kami menemui masalah untuk mencapai lokasi ini karena tidak terletak di jantung Seminyak dan supir taksi…"
Bugan Villas,Mengecewakan dan di luar harapan kami,11/01/2016,"Kami sampai di villa pada pukul 9 malam dan coba tebak, kami disambut oleh sebuah villa yang terlihat sangat kotor. Lantainya berdebu, sama juga dengan toiletnya. Sepertinya tak ada yang menginap di sana selama bertahujn-tahun. Yang terburuk adalah kolam renangnya. Air di kolam renangnya terlihat sangat kotor dan mungkin menjadi tempat yang bagus untuk membiakkan nyamuk berton-ton, karena terlihat nyamuk beterbangan di kamar kammi. Sarapannya disediakan di dua hari selama kami di sana, dengan porsi sedikit. Dua buah roti kecil, satu telur dan hot dog (hot dog yang bukan berukuran biasa tapi sepotong hot dogyang menyedihkan). Saya sangat kecewa dan terlihat sangat berbeda dengan yang dilihat di fotonya. Ini adalah terakhir kali kami di sini. Semoga sukses kepada siapa saja…"
Arya Arkananta Eco Resort & Spa,Best Place either short escape or longstay,08/01/2021,"Originally planned to stay here for 1 week, ended up staying for 1 month plus. The atmosphere of this resort is super comfortable, located in the middle of rice fields, only accessible by two and three-wheeled vehicles, making this location far from traffic noise. The food served at the Takir restaurant are all delicious, looks fancy and tastes GREAT! The Kopitiam breakfast menu is the best in Ubud. The rooms are cozy, spacious and clean, the staffs are friendly, a strong sense of family is felt at this resort, feels like home. Chamber Stone therapy at this resort is no joke, when my body is fine I won't feel anything, but when my body has problems, these stones can heal the right part of the body that has problems, as well as the healing massage. Both of these therapies are…"

Four Star by Trans Hotel,Lovely city hotel in Denpasar Area,09/01/2021,"Ola ! Wanna sharing for my experience stay in Four Star hotel by the Trans. City hotel but you don't need worry about their service. Hotel location so strategic, near Mall (Plaza Renon) 5 min walking distance only. They have parking area also for car and motorcycle. My room reservation is suite room. The highest category in this hotel. Room was so big. Living room, bedroom, bathroom was so big. I think we can play football inside the room LOL. Room so clean with good Wi-Fi. So comfortable to stay and especially their bathtub, so good to get some relax time. I try order their room service also, the staff informed that they have a promotion. So I try to order Nasi goreng jawa, with fried banana and ice lemon tea. And walaa, food so yummy, and i really enjoyed my dinner. For…"
Puri Padi Hotel,Nyaman dengan harga yang sesuai,07/01/2014,"Saya tinggal di kamar lantai 2 di gedung nomor 5 (hanya 4 kamar per bangunan) selama lima hari. Kamar yang luas dengan tempat tidur twin yang nyaman. Properti baik terletak hanya 3-5 menit berjalan ke hutan monyet. Sarapannya prasmanan ketika hotel ini penuh dan dibuat untuk memesan ketika itu hanya sebagian diduduki (aku lebih suka yang dibuat untuk memesan pancake pisang dan piring buah). Baik nilai untuk uang (kita dibayar $ 50 / nite). Kami menggunakan kolam renang setiap hari dan tampaknya menjadi satu-satunya orang mengambil saus. ada pilihan makan yang baik semua dalam 5 sampai 15 menit berjalan kaki dari hotel. Bottom line, saya akan tinggal di hotel lagi."

Morabito Art Cliff,Most Unique and Amazign Place I've Ever Stayed!,08/01/2021,"I can't say enough amazing things about Morabito Art Cliff! It's been a dream to stay here for so long, and I'm almost in tears writing this because it's been a dream come true now! We have now stayed here 2 times, and plan on coming back again and again. Hands down the most unique place I've ever stayed. Nestled on the cliff of Bingin Beach in Uluwatu, this place has the best views I've ever seen, the rooms are all so unique and filled with character. The staff is super helpful and really friendly. I will never forget the moments we created here, and I guarantee that anyone that is considering staying here will create priceless and timeless memories as well."
MAMAKA by Ovolo,An amazing stay at Mamaka Bali,10/01/2021,"The hotel located in front of Kuta Beach and near Beachwalk mall. I stayed at top gun suite room for two nights. Everything was amazing! The room very clean, the facilities so complete (Apple TV, Marshall speaker, etc), they even give us compliment mini bar, all the staff sooo friendly and hotel facilities very good. They even have some washing machine and the guest can use that for free. They also have a very beautiful rooftop bar! You can see a very beautiful Kuta Beach from the rooftop. See you again Mamaka, I will definitely back again ❤️"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,Warm and helpfull Staff,10/01/2021,"Pengalaman yang menyenangkan saat kami menginap di Mamaka selama 6 hari..Hotelnya bersih, ruang kamarnya unik dan ada teras outdoor, dilengkapi dengan wifi internet yang baik dan smart TV, Kolam Renang di bagian atap gedung dengan pemandangan ke pesisir pantai yang hebat, sarapannya dengan porsi yang cukup, lokasi hotel tepat di depan pantai, dan yang utama Staff-nya (Jadna) sangat perhatian dan membantu keperluan saya selama menginap di hotel.. Puas dan berkesan..!!"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,My fun-taztic stay!,10/01/2021,"The property is amazing, setting of the room is great, wonderful king size bed and comfy pillows! Gitta the manager is an example of excellence! She provided genuine care while assisting me from from pre-arrival and ensure everything was perfect during my stay. Well done! Melinda the Director was fantastic! She was very friendly and helpful. She is running a very tight ship and providing an experience worth coming back for. Kudos to her! Last but not least, Jaena the front desk was so courteous and fast enough to do my check in process! Awesome!"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,Perfection at it’s best,10/01/2021,"As an avid traveller I have stayed in many hotels over the years… and I am not one to make a review unless the expectation goes way beyond. Mamaka by Ovolo is by far the best property I have stayed at. It’s not just the attention to detail the hotel provides but the staff are absolutely outstanding. Upon leaving my room, I noticed the General Manager (Joel) actually working with the housekeeping staff, cleaning rooms. Definitely the most hands on GM I’ve noticed. Obviously this leadership resonates with the staff resulting in a hotel that is second to none. Highly recommend!"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,"Suuper friendly, nice room, clean room, nice facilities, nice location, SUPER DOG FRIENDLY!",09/01/2021,"We were super shocked to have discovered this nice of a hotel this late! I can only assume this hotel would be super crowded once the pandemic is over just because they are super well-maintained. Plus, it is right in front of kuta beach and it is DOG FRIENDLY!!! They treated Chero nicely and all the staffs love chero. I cant lie, i love it when a dog friendly property treats my dog with love, because when you are a dog-friendly property, YOU ARE meant to be friendly to my dog. Just like how mamaka did! Definetely recommended and will come back! Love, Chero💓"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,MY NEW BALI GO-TO HOTEL + HANG OUT!,08/01/2021,"From the moment I stepped into Mamaka, Bali, I was welcomed with good vibes from each of the staff! Such an awesome first impression, which continued throughout my entire long stay. Nothing was too much trouble! As a health + freedom entrepreneur I’ve stayed in a multitude of hotels across the globe and this by far has the funkiest fit out, and the most modern equipped hotel gym I’ve ever trained in! I can’t rave about this enough as it’s always the first thing I look at when selecting a hotel! Mamaka’s beachfront location is awesome for all levels of surfing or just for a swim, and the rooftop sunsets are spectacular, as are the cocktails and huge swimming pool! Little touches like free washing machines, towels in the gym, all toiletries and hand sanitiser everywhere…"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,Spectacular hotel with stunning views,08/01/2021,"I have been staying at Mamaka for the last 3 weeks and couldn't be happier! My Swagger suite is spacious for long stays, with everything that I need, with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. The rooms are decorated in a fresh beach chic feel, most with ocean views. This hotel is right opposite Kuta beach with easy access for surfing and swimming. The staff are amazing and can't do enough for you, and cater for all needs. The gym is so well equipped and kept spotless. There are plenty of lounge beds by the rooftop pool so no one misses out, and gets sunshine all day with a lovely breeze and spectacular views of Kuta and the coastline. I can't recommend this hotel enough....truly amazing!!!"

Anari Villas Kuta,Honeymoon stay with husband,10/01/2021,"Stay 6 malam di Anari Villas Kuta, lokasi strategis, dekat dengan pusat kota, suasana hening ga terdengar suara2 jalan raya jadi cocok bgt untuk yang mau beristirahat stelah full sharian muter2 bali, staff ramah semua dan fast respon.. kebersihn cukup baik walaupun msh ada yang miss disudut2 ruangan, but its okay so far.. drainase kamar mandi sepertinya salah penempatan, karena air menggenang tidak mengarah ke tempat drainase.. kolam renang nya private kereenn cukup luas dan terawat, parkiran mobil juga tersedia pas bgt untuk yang mau road trip ke bali.. bs sewa berbagai bentuk floaties dan tersedia jasa laundry shari jadiiiii 🙏 thank u Anari Villa Kuta"
Hotel Baruna,Besar nilai untuk uang,11/01/2017,"Di Baruna adalah kualitas yang baik anggaran akomodasi.

Staf yang sangat ramah dan membantu akan kebutuhan transportasi."
Raffles Bali,Five stars,09/01/2021,"This is truly the best hotel in Bali I have been to. The first thing that impresses is the beautiful nature in which the hotel fits so harmoniously. This is a truly exclusive place for Bukit. And of course the service, it was just great. I definitely recommend visiting this hotel."
Villa Victoria Nusa Penida,READ FIRST BEFORE BOOKING!!,10/01/2021,"Read before booking anywhere!!! The photos of Villa Victoria do not do this place justice...it far exceeds all expectations (despite having all the 5-star reviews and setting the expectations high) and is the nicest place we have stayed in Indonesia. From the top quality bedding that offered the best night sleep (best mattress and pillows, so comfortable!), to the sealed bedrooms so you never have mosquito problems, deep copper bath, large bathrooms with double vanity, beautiful towels and linen, the decor design was stunning and everywhere has panoramic views over the ocean (with Bali and the mountains in the background!) Every tiny detail has been considered in this villa. It should be referred to as a 5-star retreat space! The owners are a Brazilian and Russian couple and…"
Autentik Nusa Penida,Incredible experience,08/01/2021,Stayed here for one night with friends and had an amazing time! Definitely would have booked for longer if we’d known how incredible it was in advance :) beautiful location and easy to find - something that can’t be said for everywhere on Penida. Staff were lovely and helpful and arranged everything we needed - even let us have late checkout. Free breakfast was delicious. Would 100% stay again
Abian Kokoro,最近の常宿です。,06/01/4005,最近はここばかり宿泊しています。 安くて朝食がまあまあでバスタブがあってお湯もふんだんに出るところが気に入ってます。ロケーションもハルディスまで歩けない距離じゃないし周りはワルンとスパだらけでいいところです。最近はプールまで作っちゃったです。ごく最近オーナーさんが変わったみたいでabian KokoroじゃなくAkarsa kokoroになりましたね、実は今回は宿決めてませんでした。宿泊する当日空港で搭乗直前にブッキングコムのメールの通知をみで直前激安価格と言うことで3泊しましたが朝食付きで１泊1700円とまさしく激安でした。
Candra Cottage,Expérience immanquable,08/01/2021,"Nous devions passer 2 nuits à Candra Cottage et avons prolongé notre séjour d'une nuit. La vue depuis les deux chambres de la guest house est incroyable. Le sunset et le sunrise sont magnifiques. Une vue à 360 sur les rizières. Les chambres sont propres et la literie très confortable. Le petit déjeuner inclus est délicieux et copieux : nasi goreng, fruits, pisang goreng et boisson chaude. Priscilla saura vous faire sentir à l'aise. Elle partage avec authenticité sa vie balinaise et saura vous conseiller sur les diverses activités immanquables de la région (cascades, rizières, plantation de café et de clous de girofle). Cette immersion totale dans la culture balinaise et dans un lieu magnifique reste l'un des meilleurs moments que j'ai passé à Bali."
"SOTIS Villa Canggu, Bali",Unhappy,08/01/2021,Villa was pretty damaged and I came back to look at it 3 times to make sure it was getting fix and manager was confirmed with us that the place would be ready for us on the day and on moving day he decided not to stick to his deal and instead just give it off to someone else without letting us have a chance of saying much and any kind of notifications. Just said good luck.. so basically wasted me and my friends time going down to check the place 3 times… Pretty bad management to be honest.
Telaga Beach View,Cukup sekali dan pengalaman kurang bagus!!! Ada apa di room 3 ?🤣🤣,09/01/2021,"Melalkukan pembayaran jangan sampai terkecoh dinmintai ktp pada saat cek out , seharusnya di mintai ktp saat cek in ,Kamar nya sangat kotor kamar mandi bau dan pipa shower bocor ,atap bocor .

JAPA Suites & Villas,"Japa Ubud, 2 thumbs",10/01/2021,"Even though the whole area of this hotel is not very big, but every rooms are special especially the villas. As a new hotel, Japa is trying to give the best service at their best rate. I stayed at 1bedroom villa with private pool, which is really a pool where you can stretch up swimming.. inside it has bath tub, seperated shower, double basin, complete amenities (not cheap one), safe deposit box, sleepers, umbrella, kimonos and the most important (for me) is high quality of bed and pillow. The breakfast is limited but.. the taste is 5 star!! And my fave drink is there... sugarcane!!! Till we order more for this drink.. of course.. their hospitality is super... Attentive and fast response."
JAPA Suites & Villas,Your absolute extended family in Bali!,10/01/2021,"I visited Japa with my friends. Other people said, its like home away from home, for us, we felt like we met our extended family in Bali. From pre-arrival until post-departure, Mr. Gilang, Kencana, Basir and other team make us felt special, we felt belong there and they truly understand our needs. The location is just perfect, we can walked easily near Pengosekan and Monkey Forest. The one bedroom pool villa super comfortable and spacious! The pool is perfect for nice evening chill. 24/7 virtual service via WA, that is the best idea ever! For dining experience I can say that Tebu is amazing, not just the set up, the food but also the people, they engage very well with us. And oh, I love their welcome drink ""Yeh Tebu"" and the turn down amenities ""Jaja Satuh"", as a Balinese it's…"
JAPA Suites & Villas,A PEACEFUL & LUXURIOUS RESORT IN CENTRAL UBUD,08/01/2021,"Japa Suites & Villas is perfectly located in Ubud for access to excellent restaurants, massage, night clubs, stores and the famous Yoga Barn! The resort is located 100 meters off the street so that it is quiet and peaceful at all times, even thought the busy street is nearby. The rooms are luxuriously appointed with high quality beautiful furnishings and HD TV with many channels including Netflix, Amazon and more. The pool, spa, lobby and cafe are elegant and a pleasure to enjoy for the ultimate in comforts and convenience.

Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Adam Smith, Hot Biker Babes and Bashful Honeymooners",05/01/2019,"Or…..PERSPECT THIS.... AWESOME or AWESOME? User PERPECTIVE will determine the answer. -THE ECONOMIC PURISTS’ PERSPECTIVE. Are these spartan boxes with a bed worth the high (for Bali) ask? I don’t remember much of ECONOMICS 101 on account I was daydreaming about the hot biker-babe in the front row, but I think some dude named ADAM SMITH claimed no price is excessive if it clears the market. And considering these rooms were booked solid during my stay it looks like from the ECONOMIC PURISTS’ PERSPECTIVE they aren’t overpriced. But I’m not too sure about dodgy economics – not called it the DISMAL SCIENCE for nothing. Consider that old saw: ask 4 economists their viewpoint and you’ll get 27 different opinions. -SURFER DUDES’ PERSPECTIVES will be overall positive – there are few…"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Layanan buruk, tidak bersih, pemandangan indah",05/01/2019,"Sangat sulit tiba di sini karena Anda harus menaiki tangga yang sangat curam dan tidak bisa berkendara di tempat yang dekat. Ruangan yang sangat sederhana dan sangat kotor, dengan pemandangan yang menakjubkan. Bagian terburuknya adalah orang-orang yang bekerja di sini; sangat tidak baik, tidak membantu dan bahkan kasar. Membuat kami merasa sangat tidak diinginkan. Tidak lokasi yang baik untuk apa pun yang lebih lama dari 2 hari tinggal di pendapat saya. Makanan juga tidak baik."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,hanya lokasi,05/01/2019,"satu hal terbaik - pemandangan yang menakjubkan dari teras. Ini adalah pertama kalinya dalam hidup saya bahwa saya hidup di atas lautan. Malam aku bisa mendengar lautan, menyaksikan matahari terbit dan terbenam, itu hanya wow! ! ! ! Berbicara tentang kamar - ya tuhan, nenek saya di desa hidup lebih baik. Tidak ada air panas, kamar mandi kotor dan basah. Bahkan pancuran pun hanya pipa dari tembok. Tempat tidur - baik, saya hal selimut belum pernah dicuci. . . handuk berbau segar, ok. Wi fi bagus. Lanjutkan - mereka perlu sedikit berinvestasi di kamar dan kemudian itu akan menjadi lokasi yang sempurna, tanpa layanan bintang 5 dan kamar, tetapi dengan lokasi yang menakjubkan."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Lebih baik tidak memilih tempat ini,05/01/2019,"Tidak ada jalan ke tempat itu sehingga Anda harus membawa semua barang Anda ke tebing melalui tangga yang licin dan curam selama sekitar 10 menit. Kamar tidak bersih dan tempat tidak terlihat seperti di foto. Perlu pembaruan yang tepat. Kamar mandi juga sangat buruk. Kami memesan tempat melalui Pemesanan sehingga tidak dapat membatalkan tetapi kami memutuskan untuk tidak tidur di tempat ini. Mereka mencoba menawarkan kamar 'lebih baik' dengan AC tapi tetap saja itu sangat buruk. Dan mereka meminta Rp 600.000! ! ! Hanya di atas tebing ada resort yang bagus di mana Anda dapat menginap dengan harga yang sama (kami membayar 250, 000 IDR per malam) dan mendapatkan kamar bersih yang bagus dengan kolam renang."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Pemandangan menakjubkan / di bawah rata-rata kamar dan layanan,05/01/2019,"Tidak ada wi - fi di kamar, tidak ada wi - fi di luar kamar kami juga. Tanpa AC dan kipas tidak berfungsi dengan benar. Toilet flush rusak. Anda pura-pura mandi, tetapi hanya air DINGIN yang keluar dari sesuatu dari dinding. Pasti yang terbaik tentang tempat ini adalah lokasi. Tempat berselancar hanya di depan. Setelah berselancar Anda hanya bisa duduk dan menonton orang lain berselancar selama berjam-jam. Anda dapat menikmati sarapan di bar bawah, untuk harga yang bagus. Harus punya uang tunai di Bingin!"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Menjijikkan,05/01/2019,Tempat terburuk yang pernah ada! Tidak tinggal di sini! Kamar mandi yang menjijikkan dan ada tikus di tempat tidur! ! Ya pemandangannya bagus tapi tidak ada yang lain!
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Staf kasar, tapi pemandangan yang indah",05/01/2019,"Berhati-hatilah jika Anda memesan kamar AC. Ini adalah lokasi terpencil dan sangat dasar, sehingga diharapkan tidak semuanya bekerja dengan sempurna. Saya tidak punya masalah dengan itu, namun, jika AC rusak, Nyoman tidak akan sangat akomodatif, tidak akan menawarkan untuk membiarkan Anda mengganti kamar, dan tidak akan mengganti biaya apa pun. Ini terjadi pada saya, dan ketika saya diminta untuk berganti ke ruang AC (kosong) yang lain, dia berkata tidak, dan sangat pendek dan mudah tersinggung dengan saya. Lalu saya bertanya apakah saya bisa mendapatkan uang kembali, dan dia segera mengatakan kepada saya untuk berkemas dan bertukar kamar, dan sekali lagi sangat kasar dan terburu-buru, mengeluh bahwa saya bahkan menginginkan AC karena ""Bali panas, tidak seperti negara Anda"" .…"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Lokasi bagus dengan layanan yang buruk,05/01/2019,"Ulasan sebelumnya sangat akurat dengan foto dan lokasinya. Tempatnya tenang di pantai yang sepi, dan tampaknya setiap kamar memiliki akses ke balkon dengan pemandangan yang luar biasa. Penukaran makanan terbatas dan Rata-rata, jadi saya tidak mengerti mengapa dia mendapat banyak pujian. Namun, alasan untuk satu bintang adalah layanannya. Mereka tampak baik-baik saja jika tidak ada yang salah, tetapi hari terakhir kami AC rusak. Kami memahami bahwa hal-hal terjadi dan tidak masalah untuk pergi tanpa AC, kecuali fakta bahwa ruangan itu dua kali lipat harga dari yang tanpa AC. Ruang AC yang lain kosong, tetapi mereka menolak untuk membiarkan kami bergerak selama satu malam (dan mulai terlihat marah). Tapi kemudian kami bertanya tentang pengembalian uang untuk selisih biaya ke…"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Nice place for beautiful sunset,05/01/2019,"Lokasi di pantai Bingin, berjalan kaki sekitar 250 m dari parkiran, menuruni banyak tangga dan berkelok kelok. Pantai yang tenang, santai menunggu sunset di Nyoman & Nyoman ditemani makanan ringan dan minuman yang menyegarkan. Recommended place."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Best Place i've Ever Stayed in Bali,05/01/2019,"I moved to Nyoman & Nyoman after having a terrible experience at Leggies and boy i wished i had stayed here for my full 3 weeks in Bali not just my final 5 nights. Nyoman is the most amazing host, anything you need she can help you with, shes also a very good cook. Maday is a bit cheeky when it comes to the price of certain things like Laundry and transport so also ask Nyoman when it comes to anything to do with negotiable prices. The rooms are super nice. I stayed in the room on the bottom story which had an awesome deck, nice big room and great bathroom. yes the waves can keep you awake on a big tide but you get very used to it and they almost start to put you sleep. Fair to say next time i come to Bali ill be staying here no questions asked."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Accueil,05/01/2019,"Accueil pas très chaleureux. Chambre très basique pour le prix. La région est différente du reste de l'île, par rapport aux prix et a l'accueil. Il y a assez de touristes, pas de problèmes ! Les plages sont par contre magnifiques, on en trouve même certaines très peu fréquentées."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Loved it,05/01/2019,"We came stayed here for our two nights and absolutely loved it. The beds were very comfortable and rooms stayed cool with just a fan thanks to being tucked into the cliff. Great views, food was fab at the family warung downstairs, the guys running the place where super friendly and attentive. It is basic accomodation but it's perfect, great service, comfy beds, ensuit with flushing toilet and a shower, and a view to die for! We loved it so much we went back for the last two nights of our stay. Cheap and cheerful and great value! Thank you for having us!!"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Lokasi luar biasa, indah host",05/01/2019,"Lokasi adalah benar-benar menakjubkan; jalan yang berliku jalan hutan ke dasar tebing tepat di Pantai Bingin dengan pemandangan ke Dreamlands dan apa yang tidak mungkin di selatan ke utara. Akomodasi ini sangat cocok untuk selancar yang tiada tara. Tuan rumah yang ramah dan ramah orang yang Anda akan bertemu. Makanan baik dan sangat terjangkau. Tidak ada yang terlalu banyak kesulitan, dan semuanya dilakukan dengan senyum besar dan berkata. Tidak tiba mengharapkan resor mewah. Hotel ini sederhana dan terjangkau namun nyaman dan sangat nyaman."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Quelle vue,05/01/2019,"Nous avons passé plusieurs journées chez Nyoman. La vue sur Bingin est imprenable. On s'est sentis comme des rois. Les uns allant surfer, les autres promener et se baigner. On y a très bien mangé. Les Banana Pacakes, un délice."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Pemandangan yang luar biasa, makanan besar untuk harga yang besar",05/01/2019,"Datang lapar karena porsi yang sangat besar. Kopi Bali sangat fantastis. Saya suka telur dadar, nasi goreng, mie dan teman. Dek adalah tepat di atas ombak."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Pemandangan Yang Bagus, Akomodasi Yang Buruk",05/01/2019,"Tempat ini memiliki pemandangan yang menakjubkan, tapi itu adalah hanya positif. Benar-benar mahal, kamar mandi berbau seperti urin dan ac tidak bekerja. Ketika meminta diskon karena ac tidak bekerja, kami diperlakukan dengan sikap dan menolak kompensasi apapun oleh seorang wanita yang bekerja di sana. Hanya kemudian apakah nyoman datang oleh dirinya sendiri dan meminta maaf dan menawari kami diskon kecil, namun kami harus meminta beberapa kali. Malam yang buruk tidur bergesek dengan tikus di atap."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Небольшой пляж,05/01/2019,"Пляж находится южнее Куты. Для пляжного отдыха он не совсем подходит из-*за больших волн. Для сёрферов - вполне нормально. Для пляжа характерна довольно узкая береговая полоса вдоль обрывистого берега. Тут же есть одноимённое кафе, в котором можно посидеть и полюбоваться хорошими видами на море."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Makanan yang hebat, wanita baik",05/01/2019,Pemandangan dari tempat tersembunyi ini sangat luar biasa. Balkon adalah pantai. Makanan enak dan murah juga pelayanannya sangat bagus. Semuanya bagus!
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Lokasi yang bagus, akomodasi yang buruk",05/01/2019,"Lokasi yang bagus untuk peselancar yang ingin menyewa papan. 50 000 untuk menyewa papan. Wanita tua yang bekerja di sana sangat membantu jika anda meminta tetapi berbicara sedikit bahasa inggris dan melengking yang banyak. Mereka juga tidak memesan sebuah kamar untuk kami, jadi kami harus mendapatkan lain dan berbagi tempat tidur. Seprai dan bantal yang lembab, toilet flush manual, sayangnya tidak ada shower di sebelah toilet pipa yang menetes air dingin. Kami tidak benar-benar memiliki keran sedikit selang jadi kami harus menggunakan sepasang catut untuk menyalakannya dan off. Harap tetangga anda tidak begitu berisik karena dindingnya anyaman dan semua kamar mandi terhubung di bagian atas. Banyak langkah sehingga anda perlu untuk dapat secara fisik. Lokasi yang indah meskipun…"

Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Rumah yang jauh dari rumah,05/01/2019,"Aku hanya menyukai tempat ini! Kamar adalah tepat di atas air dan anda dapat mendengar ombak memecah di malam hari, dengan pompa berselanca di siang hari. Keluarga ini juga benar-benar indah dan membuat anda merasa di rumah. Saya telah ke bali 25 kali dan ini masih tempat favorit saya."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Tinggal untuk pelancong dengan dana terbatas,05/01/2019,"Awak adalah sebuah tempat tinggal yang nyaman bagi pelancong hemat. Kota ini terletak di atas tebing di samping bingin - hampir tepat di atas air. Kamar dasar, tapi ini bersih linen. Hanya terdapat shower air dingin. Laci besar bagi kami adalah pemandangan dan dek ruang di depan kamar kami. Sangat bagus untuk wisatawan muda. Tidak menganjurkan keluarga yang menginap dengan anak-anak kecil atau orang yang menginginkan sedikit kemewahan. Langkah-langkah yang sangat curam! Telah tinggal yang nyaman dan menyenangkan."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Susan dari bingin,05/01/2019,"Souvenir & souvenir di bingin beach adalah yang terbaik! Kami tinggal di sini di maret 2015 selama lebih dari dua minggu. Kami menyukai staf, yang baik, pemandangan dan akomodasi kami. Kami tinggal di pertama di atas dapur namun kami pindah ke salah satu kamar di atas restoran di tahap berikutnya, ada sentuhan lebih mewah - kami berada di bulan madu setelah semua. Makanan di souvenir adalah besar. Saya pikir saya akan makan burger yang pernah hari. Di samping pemandangan menakjubkan ini benar-benar mengagetkan dirinya dan tim yang luar biasa akan membuat masa tinggal anda di sini jadi istimena. Anda benar-benar bangun untuk wanita tertawa, suasana yang khusus. Kami meninggalkan setelah yang pertama kami pergi ke untuk pulau melucuntukan dari sumatera dan ketika kami kembali, itu…"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Toppen!,05/01/2019,"En jättemysig plats! Rummen var helt okej, inget extra men utsikten är helt fantastisk. Ett familj home stay och dom tar vara på dig som om ni har känt varandra länge. Frukosten var inte inkluderat men fanns mycket att välja mellan för ett mycket godkänt pris. Gott var det också! Vi betalade ca 500k för ett aircondition rum. Finns även fläkt rum som är hälften av priset. Är det något du behöver så hjälper dom dig oavsett vad, om du behöver surflektioner eller om du behöver skjuts till en annan stad så ställer dom upp. Det enda som är negativt är trapporna ner till hemmet. Speciellt när du går med 20kg på ryggen (hemmet ligger längst ner på trappan)"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Indah,05/01/2019,"Teman saya dan saya direkomendasikan tempat ini oleh seorang gadis yang kami memesan beberapa perjalanan melalui hotel. Dia mengatakan kepada kami itu adalah seperti sebuah harta karun untuk menemukan dan ia benar! Tempat ini sangat menyenangkan, tepat di pantai dan kamar depan 100x lebih baik daripada hostel dasar anda. tempat tidur yang nyaman, kamar mandi dasar tetapi anda tidak perlu apa-apa lebih dari benar-benar dan shower! Pemandangan yang luar biasa menghadap pantai sehingga matahari terbenam yang luar biasa. Kami memesan dua malam dan berakhir tinggal selama seminggu. Ibu ida dan anak-anaknya adalah yang paling jenis sepeda, wanita cantik dan mereka tidak bisa telah membuat saya dan teman saya merasa lagi selamat datang! Makanan adalah yang terbaik di pantai yang…"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Nyoman dan nyoman,05/01/2019,Pemandangan yang menakjubkan di sini. Tepat di atas air. Ruangan itu nyaman tetapi kamar mandi membanjiri setiap kali kami menggunakan mandi. Mandi air dingin hanya. Air panas tidak terjawab karena cuacanya yang begitu hangat. Makanan adalah besar. Mereka gadis-gadis bisa memasak! Tidak cocok untuk orang dengan masalah dikaki. Banyak banyak langkah-langkah untuk mendapatkan ke hotel dan kembali. tempat yang sangat damai. Akan menginap di sana lagi!
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Pemandangan menakjubkan dari gelombang,10/01/2014,Saya suka menginap di nyoman & nyoman karena mereka semua begitu ramah dan membuat anda merasa seperti anda di rumah yang jauh dari rumah tapi dengan memompa ombak di depan pintu anda.

Terima kasih nyoman untuk berbagi dengan kami dan keramahan anda besar rumah makanan yang dimasak. Josh t tepat anda bertemu dengan banyak bagus, menyenangkan dan bahagia orang di sini karena suasana adalah positif. Kami adalah keluarga dan menemukan itu sangat terjangkau untuk tinggal dan makan. Satu petunjuk meskipun, adalah mendapatkan anda mencuci baju di tempat lain agak mahal dari sini. MENIKMATI!"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Cool place,10/01/2014,"Good food (I tried local food) and nice view on the ocean. You can rent boards, enjoy surfing or tanning on the beach."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Itu harus telah benar-benar turun di 2014,08/01/2014,"Saya memilih Nyoma Nyoma karena review indah di sini di tripadvisor, kesalahan besar. Kamarnya bahkan di sebelah pantai dan penempatan tidak bisa ditingkatkan. Meskipun demikian, staf adalah cukup ramah dan terus bertanya pertanyaan seperti tempat aku akan setiap kali aku meninggalkan homestay. Saya membayar 200 000 rp per malam sementara akomodasi yang sama baik dapat ditemukan untuk 100 000 di sisi lain pantai. Tidak layak sama sekali. Saya punya kamar memesan untuk dua minggu dan di hari ketiga saya, hanya ketika saya datang kembali dari pantai di sekitar 12, wanita (yang saya kira adalah pemilik) mengatakan kepada saya dia telah menyewa kamar saya ke orang lain dan bahwa saya harus meninggalkan dalam waktu dua jam. Saya kira dia menemukan orang lain bersedia untuk…"

Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Amazing stay,08/01/2014,"Recently stayed 4 nights at Nyoman Nyoman with my boyfriend and it was great. We stayed in a basic fan cooled room - the rooms are clean and spacious. Plug sockets on the balcony too which is handy for keeping the cameras charged! the views are breathtaking and it's one of the most chilled out places we've been in bali! Sunsets were incredible. The staff make you feel so welcome, the land lady in particular is lovely. Food was excellent! Highly recommend the squid and rice (ask for the garlic butter sauce). We found the best spot to swim was to the left of the hotel down the steps (less rocks). Would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to get away from the crowds and spend some time in paradise. Be warned- the steps down to the guesthouse are extremely steep !!"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,A home away from home,08/01/2014,"I stayed here for two months and was very comfortable here. Nyoman is such a sweet lady as is Made, her staff. They helped me out with my Bali Kisses!!! Food is fabulous, wifi is decent, and the beds were super comfortable. Definitely recommend this place if you plan to visit Bingin (and Bingin probably has the best vibe on Bali!!!!!!!!)"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Great food, great value, recommend!",08/01/2014,"We stayed here for a week, the accommodation was a really good price. The room was clean and a good size with amazing views of the sea. Staff all really friendly and helpful. Wifi connection was really good. We ate here most days and the food was always really nice and good value with the restaurant right on the seafront. We never used the board rental but it was good to know that it was available. Bike hire and taxi service arranged from hotel at good prices. Definitely worth the walk down the bingin steps to stay and eat. Will definitely stay again whenever in the area and highly recommend."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Great lunch spot! Worth the walk!,08/01/2014,"Looked at booking this place to stay and had good conversation with owners via email, very responsive. In the end we decided on other accommodations but wanted to make the effort to find this place at least for an amazing meals I read about. As mentioned the food was amazing, and the view overlooking the ocean, priceless. I am glad we did not book for accommodations, not because it was not nice, but is truly suited for people travelling light, or back packing as you have to walk in and down lots of stairs so just be aware as we had suitcases and it would not have been an easy access place for us. Staff so friendly, great place to chill out relax and surf is right there'd as well:)"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Had an Amazing Stay!,08/01/2014,"Was Traveling with a buddy, he went home I stayed. Had a great time with everyone there. Looking forward to returning asap. Great Food, Safe Place to Stay, Beautiful Views, Great Surf, Great Location. Best to all."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Bingin at it's best,08/01/2014,"Probably the best view of quality surf in Bali just 200m from the break. My girlfriend and I stopped by for food, drinks and a sunset and next time I'll be back to stay. The food and hospitality is brilliant, I can't praise it enough to be honest."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,worldy spot,08/01/2014,"spent 1 month in indo. stayed here first two nights. best spot the whole trip. would love to go back. try to conqquer the wave. as for the accom. so good. couldnt be in a better spot for surfing and exploring the bukit. the food was great. the nasi G was the best i had all trip, and the breaky was worldy as well. pancake with fruit salad is what's needed after a dawn patrol. cant say enough for the hosts as well. all round awesome"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Amazing views, food, rooms and owners!",08/01/2014,"We stayed at Nyoman & Nyoman for four nights last August. From the beginning you fall in love with the location, having breakfast above the balinese sea or enjoying the sunset with a Bintang. The rooms are clean, with big beds and private bathroom. Also the food is amazing, whether you like indonesian typical food or a burger. The owner and his family are very nice and they made us feel like home. I would definitely recomend his homestay, but most important I would definitely stay again."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Best balinese beach homestay,08/01/2014,"We spent 20 days in Bali and Java traveling and visiting different cities,villages and beaches and from all of the hostels,hotels and homestays we stayed, Nyoman & Nyoman was the best of them all,by far. Its unbeatable location, the wonderful views of the waves, which makes it a perfect surf spot really close to others like uluwatu, and the sunsets are just some of the charms of Nyoman & Nyoman. The food was great, the rooms were clean and the owner and his family,who really took care of us and our wellbeing, made us feel like home. It's a place I would not only just recommend to other tourists to stay in,but also a homestay I would definitly get back to."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Best chillout spot ever,08/01/2014,"I spent just over 3 months in Bali, Lombok and The Gilis and Nyoman&Nyoman was no doubt my favourite place. So much so that I returned to spend my last week there before leaving for Malaysia. Great atmosphere, amazing waves, great food and the guys working there are totally awesome. Its secluded but only 5-10 minutes from the more busy spots in the area which made it perfect for me. I will be back Nyoman&Nyoman. Oh yes, I will be back Big thanks to Putu, Nyoman, Kat and all the other guys who made this spot so good."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Best Value Around Uluwatu, Surfer's Dream Home",08/01/2014,"Great central location around Uluwatu and Padang Padang and as close as you can get to Bingin beach without getting wet. Rooms are clean and cool and view from the balcony outside your room looks out onto the break, walk out your room and 5 minutes later you are out in the lineup. Best value accomodation in Uluwatu, hands down."
The Kirana Agro Resort Tembok Tejakula,Good ambience,10/01/2021,"One of the best hotel to stay at north east of Bali, we can walk direct to the black sand beautiful beach. Humble staff, good ambience, nice garden view. A suitable place for short escape with family Sure will come back again."

Ekommunity Farmstay & Yoga,Peaceful get away in the jungle,09/01/2021,"The Ekommunity is beautiful situated, in the middle of the jungle, close to waterfalls. The tents are quite expensive, but if you‘re looking for something different: this is it. The food is excellent, they grow their own vegetables. The Yoga Deck is down by the river and very inviting. I would come back anytime!"
Aswanaya Villas & Suite,Comfortable place and gweed staff❤️,10/01/2021,"Excellent service, all staff is helpful and nice.

Aswanaya Villas & Suite,Tempat ini bener2 luar biasa!,08/01/2021,"Yg ingin berlibur ditengah sawah ubud dan tidak terlalu jauh dengan denpasar. Tempat ini reccomended bgt. Area pinggir jalan utama, parkir luas, halaman kebun yg mempesona bisa pakai party ultah dll. Kamar luas dan area bathroom menakjubkan. Yg terpenting suasana desa di tengah sawah itu anda dapatkan. Semoga pandemi segera berakhir dan villa ini juga menjadi tempat favorit anda."

Batukaru Coffee Estate,Best place to stay,10/01/2021,"We stayed 2 nights in this incredible 👍😍 jungle lodge. The host Kentri was so generous and extremely welcoming, and the staff were very friendly and professional. All the food was super fresh direct from the land in the estate, fresh clean delicious Indonesian vegetarian food. This place specialises in coffee and it was out of this world, they even have a coffee shop 300 m down the road with stunning rice views. The lodge we stayed in was so beautiful with probably some of the best views in Bali. I cannot recommend this place enough for anyone who wants to explore the real Bali."
Batukaru Coffee Estate,Recharge,09/01/2021,An amazing place the location the staff and the food. You can do as much or as little as you need to recharge your batteries. Kentri and her team are amazing - all the food is prepared from what is grown on the 10 hectare property. Even the building is made from wood from the property. Its worth getting up early for the magical sunrises where on a clear morning you can see the mountains. (Yoga shala is a magnificent spot). And at the end of the day when it gets chilly (and it does) relax by the log fire . Well worth a visit (and return) when you are craving some time with mother nature and some rnr
Batukaru Coffee Estate,Mountain Paradise!,09/01/2021,"We took a group of 10 people to Batukaru Coffee Estate for an active weekend getaway, staying 3 days and 2 nights and by the end we were wishing it was more. Batukaru always feels spiritual and empowering and being up high on her with beautiful views to the Jatiluwih terraces below and beyond to the ocean was incredible. We gave ourselves a full itinerary starting at 545am for Sunrise watch - and certainly it is worth getting up to see, even if the first day was a bit cloudy it was still amazing in a different and moving way, with our 2nd day sunrise being spectacular and breathtaking. The accommodation for us, was amazing, allowing us the communal living and togetherness but still enabling whenever you needed, your own personal space and privacy.The eclectic decoration and…"
Di Uma Sebatu,My long lost dream house ❤,08/01/2021,"Yes! It's far away from the city center even in Ubud area It's considered as ""the middle of nowhere"". Don't mind about it since it's actually the part of this place beauty ❤ Just pack your snacks and wine/rose and stays here! Enjoy the sunset and sunrise from the balcony or just open your door and enjoy it from you comfortable bed, relax.... all white joglos facing rice fields and marigolds garden perfect combo for my eyes. The bed are huge and comfortable too, the facilities are well maintained, they also have smart tv so no reasons to get bored. The staff are incredibly helpful and caring. I had accident in Ubud and the staff drove me right away to the clinic and waited. Thank you soo much 🙏"
Le Cliff Bali,The world changed around me while I stayed still..,09/01/2021,"Absolutely LOVED my stay. Was exactly what I needed... I was in room 2 and it proved to be an absolute sanctuary. I didn't have to go anywhere which was what I really wanted. With the tide high in the morning, and not so great wifi ~ it was the perfect situation to just rest! Loved it when the tide went out, just layed in the shallow water and watched the beautiful scenery. And then back up to my balcony for sunset - it really had it all for me. The bathroom was a little leaky, but that was pretty minor compared to everything the place had to offer. The staff were also super helpful and friendly. Highly recommend and next time I'm staying for 3 nights instead of 2!"
Le Cliff Bali,Just laid back place,09/01/2021,"It was super chilled, breakfast at your room/balcony. Just a lovely hide out and good surf. Great location and nice staff. If you want to relax its a great spot or even watch the pros when surfing. Xxx"
Le Cliff Bali,Wonderful view and atmosphere hotel,08/01/2021,"I love staying here very much, incredible view and very friendly atmosphere ❤. Lovely restaurant and very close to all popular restaurants and points of Uluwatu. Different rooms, all r very cute, and starting from very small check."
The Ayu Kintamani,Higly recomended,09/01/2021,"We stayed 2 nights in the villa, the bedrooms was comfortable and clean.

Thanks for Komang🙏, he is really helpful and friendly. Looking forward to see come back again.🥰"
Klapa Resort,Worst experience,09/01/2021,"Worst experience, will never come back! We paid for breakfast and all that includes is a little toast and just a americano, if you want a latte they charge you extra! If you want to order fruit they charge extra, if you want to order another toast they charge you extra! And they are very very slow! Check in is at 1 cannot enter the room earlier, even in pandemic situation with no guests on the hotel! Will not recommend it no anyone! What a disappointment!"

The Grand Bakas Jungle Retreat Villa,Nice,09/01/2021,"Location : on the border of Gianyar, Ubud separated by a river. Rooms: we had 1 bedroom villa with private pool, jungle view. Villas are big, lush green, similar to ubud vibes but a more quiter and cheaper price. Cleaned enough, if one thing was bothering us, its the old smell of pillows and sheets. Just this and i would give it a higher star. This is an old villa if not, but managed by new management so they did better at maintaining this property. Old reviews were not valid at this point. Car parking was just next to our villa. The staff (Komang) was actually the one who made our stay very nice. Breakfast was Ok."
Inna Bali Beach Resort,Garden view bungalow,09/01/2021,"Good experience stay with Inna Bali Beach Resort, and also you can park your car near of your room. And also direct acsess to the beach, if you like balinese food, there is ""Men Wety"". And I Will would like to come again."

Very very recommended if you want to get great an quiet holiday. Just relaxing on the pool with cozy corner. Best resort in sanur. Its old but it still look so beautiful. Great eating spots to explore along the waterfront. Fantastic staff...helpful, friendly...couldn't do enough for us. It's still close enough to shopping, but far enough if you just want to relax."
Inna Bali Beach Resort,Wonderfull property,08/01/2021,"When we were stayed at inna bali. This place Beautiful beach, location, very friendly staff.. 100% Comfort of the room and area.

Padi Padi Canggu Luxury Room,Beautiful place BUT filled with noisy people and a little dusty,08/01/2021,"Came here for a staycation because I read that the second floor had amazing views and the bedrooms looked clean and fresh. Staff: friendly and helpful Rooms: Beautiful but a little bit dusty. I had to take my antiseptic wet wipes and wipe down everything in the room. There were cobwebs in the corners of the ceiling. Wish they had mopped the floor too but I don't think they did. I am an OCD and a clean freak so I can tell. The doors, tables and cupboards had some stains and marks on them (not dirty just stains) - they should have spent some time polishing. Views: Amazing ricefield views from the second floor and lovely breeze. Amenities: Great, although I wish there was a desk for working. They only had a low round table. Bonus: They had a nice balcony at the back too, so if…"

The Dukuh River Retreat,Peaceful Oasis Situated in a Beautiful Area of Tabanan,08/01/2021,"The drive to this property from Canggu is less than 40 minutes and one of the prettiest drives I've taken on the island driving through all the greenery and rice fields. The room is a nice size with a big, comfortable bed and full-length mirrors. It has two patio sitting areas. The back patio is breathtaking. Nice pool in the back that we had all to ourselves with the rice field as our backdrop. There is a bbq area. Wayan has a fish hatchery. We had the best fish caught from his backyard. The Bayan tree on the way to the river on his property is a great area to do yoga. The river is beautiful and we continued to fish there too for prawns. Next time, we are going tubing on the river! The beach that is only 2 kms away I had to myself besides a few fishermen. The black sand…"
Lasamana Villas Ubud,Ubud serenity,10/01/2021,"My second stay in Ubud. A little hard to reach to the villas, it's at the middle of rice fields.

Karena kami ber 4 dewasa + 1 child kami pikir option yang ideal. Dan karena anak yang sangat ingin camping kami berpikir akan menyenangkan sekali. Reception meminta kami menunggu karena beliau mengantar tamu check in. Kekecewaan muncul ketika reception kembali ternyata menginfokan glamping yg tadi diinfo ke kami diambil oleh tamu yg check in sebelum kami.. mereka minta pindah kamar ceritanya begitu.. mungkin kedepan kalau kasusnya begitu bisa dikomunikasikan dulu dengan tamu yg baru datang.. menghindari kekecewaan seperti yang kami rasakan.. karena kasusnya reception sudah info kamar yg available itu ke kami.. kecewa sekali tapi karena ini…

Lotus Guesthouse,Love it!,10/01/2021,I'm soooo in love with this place. This beautiful little joglo is perfect and the price was way below what you should pay because it's more than you would expect for the price. Maybe because of the pandemic. Definitely would come back if we visit the island again
Bobby's Surf Adventure Resort,Bobby's Surf Camp,06/01/2011,"Surf Camps in Third World countries have their challenges, such as no running water, a porcelien bowl for a toilet, and having to be cautious of malaria carrying mosquitoes, however they also have their charms in that you never have to think of what to cook or eat (you eat what's served), you are at an isolated beach, and you have to be creative with your time if you don't surf. Bobby's Surf Camp in G-Land has become ""wife"" friendly. Our Superior Cottage had air conditioning, sattelite TV, a frig and hot water, so it did not seem we were out in the jungle, at a National Park, where monkeys, monitor lizards and pigs run free. There is so much I could write about my experience, and it was all good, but time does not permit at the moment. The memory remains with me as I'm stuck…"

Bananaleaf Hostel,"Fijne plek, maar service moet echt beter!",10/01/2018,"Bij aankomst waren we erg te spreken over het mooie verblijf. Wij zaten in het hostel, die was erg schoon en netjes met airco. Het was wel bijna het dubbele wat we gewend waren te betalen voor hostels, maar hier had je wel een zwembad bij en een ontbijt erbij in zitten. Het zwembad was mooi en had mooie zitzakken/bedden eromheen. Het ontbijt kan echt beter. Wij moesten meer dan 50 minuten wachten op een simpel ontbijt. Er waren maar 2 personen voor ons die hun ontbijt moesten krijgen. Doordat het zo lang duurde moesten we, naar 2 keer te hebben aangedrongen dat het eten echt moest komen, het eten naar binnen lopen schansen om op tijd te zijn voor de taxi die kwam voor onze duiktrip. Sap uit pak vind ik ook niet kunnen voor een omgeving waar zoveel vers fruit is en voor het…"

The Avatara Bali Villa,Unbelievable place to stay,07/01/2014,"We took the family to Avatara for two weeks over Easter, and despite having high expectations of the property, these were blown away by the reality. We called it 'the Palace' as it was like coming home to your own private 5 star hotel after a day out exploring. The suites (especially upstairs) are stunning, and the whole atmosphere is peaceful and charming. The staff quickly became like family and obviously loved having 2 small children there. Hoping to return next year."
The Avatara Bali Villa,"`Avatara` at Nyanyi,Bali",07/01/2014,"I stayed at ` Avatara` with my husband,daughter and her partner.....we all agreed it would be hard to find a more pleasing accomodation in Bali.

The house itself is stunning with every comfort one dreams of,the interiors boast a collection of object from bali and outlying Islands,the pool is easily the best I`ve ever seen. We were made very welcome by the staff who catered to every need and always with a big smile. We look forward to our next stay."
Villa Isabella Bali,"Love Bali, but Avoid Villa Isabella",11/01/2015,"Villa Isabella near Ubud, Bali, link <[--]>, lived up to its ""13"" status. Run by a French woman (Isabella) and her partner (Englishman) is a potential tourist trap. The living quarters are beautiful, the house is in a spectacular location but .... opposite the villa are the loudspeakers of the local village temple. Our 3 weeks booking coincided with a 10 day celebrations clearly marked in the local calendar. Prayers were broadcast day and night for 10 days straight. We love to be exposed to local culture, but I doubt any but deaf westerner would enjoy his stay in Villa Isabella. The owners know exactly what the problem is but would not tell you in advance even if you asked (we did ask if the place was quiet before we made a reservation). This would explain why we…"
