The Apurva Kempinski Bali,A Moment (Wedding) To Remember,10/01/2021,"This place is always so comfy and cozy. With its luxury interior and a touch of Balinese feel on the exterior, you will feel that you are in paradise. I had my wedding here in Apurva and kudos to the team. They are very professional, warm and I feel that I am in good hands. Shout out especially to Ros for always catering to our needs. I always have low expectation on Hotel food but the food they serve here exceeds my expectation. Very delicious indeed. As for the spa, it is so Zen and peaceful. Very relaxing and definitely took my mind off from the stressful life and took the fatigue away. Great place to just relax, or even have a great event in this amazing place. Definitely coming back for more :)"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Nice hotel but the service could be better,10/01/2021,"We stayed at Apurva Kempinski for 2 nights for our honeymoon. Room was good and clean. The hotel has a lot of instagramable spots. We tried dinner at Bai Yun restaurant (the food and the service were really good) & breakfast at reef restaurant. Unfortunately we feel the Covid-19 protocol during breakfast could be better, while they let the staffs help with taking your food they combine all the guests inside one restaurant without social distancing so it was pretty cramped. We also had problems with the service such as luggage delivery & room assistance being slow and the showerhead in our room fell off, but the manager Steffi already managed & assisted us in solving our problems so we're left pretty satisfied with how the problems were handled."
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,The Wedding,10/01/2021,"The Best Service from Ms. Deviana Ros n Ms. Elsa Sangat bertanggung jawab terhadap kita dan cepat tanggap dlm handle kita. Very Good lah to Ms. Deviana Ros, semua urusan beliau cepat handle, berpengalamanüôè"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Sangat menyenangkan,10/01/2021,"Kamarnya bagus dan bersih Staff hotel ramah dan sangat membantu. Tidak ribet. Peraturan hotel tidak kaku jd bikin nyaman. Luas bangettttt 14 hektar. Karna luas lift nya jd agak bingungin awal nya tapi hari berikutnya ud hafal. Kalau buat yg suka stay di hotel ga mau kemana2 pasti ngerasain nyaman banget banyak tempat hotel yg di explore. Tapi kalau yg suka jalan2 keluar, hotel cuman buat tidur saja kurang cocok karna lokasi agak jauh dari Kuta Seminyak."
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Great hotel with superb facilities,09/01/2021,"We booked both suite and deluxe room. Both rooms were well maintained. Beware, the hotel area is very big. Be prepared to walk a lot to get around the hotel. They provide buggy tho. The staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful too. Kids playground is great. We asked for baby crib and they provided some basic amenities for baby too. It will be one of our preferred hotel to stay in Bali and would definitely recommend it to others too"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,wonderful experience,10/01/2021,"I had a wonderful experience here. Every staff member I encountered were delightful and eager to help. The sevice was exceptional as well. Looking forward to my next stay, will recommend to friends as well."
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Excellent Service,10/01/2021,"Dari awal masuk, proses check in, menunggu jam check in sampai pengantaran ke room pelayannannya super baik dan ramah. Sambil dijelaskan banyak fasitilas yang digunakan. Fasilitas cukup banyak, makanan enak, kamar luass.. Will soon back here again."
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Nice hotel,10/01/2021,"This is my second stay in this hotel, first time was 2 years ago with my family. This time I came with my husband and we tries the cliff private pool ocean suite. I am a little disappointed with the room, I got the one on 11th floor and the room is next to the alley of the lift, so everybody going to and from the lift can see the room, especially the pool and the bathup very clear. Even there‚Äôs one time a security guard walk pass by and wave at me while I‚Äôm in the pool. I think there‚Äôs no privacy at all, and the bathup with the ocean view is a waste because we cannot open the curtain. However, everything else about this hotel is very nice. The hotel staff are all very polite, nice, and friendly. You should try the restaurant especially Bai Yun and Izakaya, the food is very‚Ä¶"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Good experince,10/01/2021,"This is the best villa lounge ever, amazing atmosphere, good food and cleanliness, staffs also so explainable any information and thank you to the staff mbak Fitri to helpful us. We will back soon!!!!"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,A better experience than before,09/01/2021,"This is our 3rd visit in a year. And the last one is the better experience than before. All staffs are so helpfull and always greeted us when we passed by. Please send my regards to Mr. Irawan in Front Desk for helping me get the best view room (I think the hotel reaches 60% Occupancy and I requested it when I'm checking in, btw). He also noticed that i have a son and send a little gift to him. In our stay, we also have a dinner in Bai Yun (Chinese) Restaurant. I think this is the best Hot Pot restaurant in Bali right now. Definitely will be back again :) If you are looking for a famliy friendly hotel, The Apurva Kempinski Bali should be in the top of the list. Thank you apurva kempinski bali!"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,SPECTACULAR,10/01/2021,"When we arrived at the resort, our car could not enter the building because a government event was being held that day. Our car had to circle for about 15 minutes. In the end, many guests were forced to walk from the parking lot to the lobby. We stayed for two nights in Cliff Private Pool Ocean View room and couldn‚Äôt ask for a better experience for real. The amenities, the bed, and the view are excellent. The sunrise view from our room is spectacular. All other facilities that they provide in the resort make you never bored during the stay I want to express my gratitude to Mr. Arya Wirawan, the Cliff lounge manager, who has accommodated our complaints during the check-in process. His professionalism, empathy, and hospitality make our stay even more memorable in The Apurva‚Ä¶"

The Apurva Kempinski Bali,The Worst Resort Service in Bali,10/01/2021,"DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL UNLESS YOU LIKE TO BE TREATED INHUMANLY!! Talked to my relatives and friends, who stayed in this hotel before, about my bad experience, they ALL came across a similar experience as mine! This is my second visit. My first visit was 3 months ago and the experience was horrible. Since my son likes their water slides, we decided to give this hotel a second chance. No surprise, this hotel ruined our holiday AGAIN. I did write a review to the hotel after my first stay but received no response nor improvement. Clearly, they ignored guests comments. Let me LIST what I had been through during these two stays (total 7 nights): 1. Four of us stayed in a Jr cliff ocean suite with extra bed and one child breakfast had been paid in advance. WHENEVER we go to the‚Ä¶"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Probably the best hotel and resort in Bali.,10/01/2021,"We stayed here for 4 days. We moved from front ocean to Sanghari villa. It is very nice villa and to be honest probably the best in Bali. We are back here after 2 years without travelling. It is a payback time :) + Clean room, friendly staff, big bed, nice view, nice breakfast ( lots of selection ), - Difficult finding parking especially when no driver."
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Our second stay,09/01/2021,"Our second visit to this hotel, this time we were a couple celebrating our honeymoon. Before we stay, Ms. Armini from Reservation Team very helpful to arranged our room and also arranged my family room. Checked in was smooth with Ms. Diana assistance & also checked out was great with Mr. Deni assistance. We had lunch at The Reef Beach Club and we had our dinner at Izakaya by Oku. The staff are amazing and very friendly. Shout out to Ms. Devi at Izakaya bu Oku who assisted us during our dinner time with complimentary honeymoon cake & ice cream. During breakfast at Pala Restaurant, Mr. Hariasa, Ms. Sariani, dan Mr. Ngurah were very helpful.

The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Perfect Staycation,09/01/2021,"We have just spent our 2nd nights out of our planned 4-nights here. So far evrything are flawless and we were impressed since our arrival and being picked up at the airport. My wife (a Gold Discovery Kempinski Member) and I picked the Ocean Cliff Junior Suite with private pool. Check-in process was smoothly done helped by Demi(?) at the lounge. The premises area is huge with beach front. Room is spacious with contemporary design of dark woods touch. Amenities are abundant. Suite guesses are given complimentary breakfast at the Cliff Lounge which we love the selection both ala carte and buffet menus. In room dining meals also suits to our taste and portion referrence.

The building, the facilities, the services and the staff are exceptional! Not to mention a bad experience I had when I lost my access card after playing at the beach, the front desk staff, Mr Irawan and Miss Tami (not really remember the name but really want to give a credit to her as she is also very lovely) are so very helpful with the process of us getting a new access card without hesitation. For overall experiences I would love to give all staffs and facilities 100000000 out of 10!"

The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Best View Hotel in Nusa Dua Bali and Romantic Koral Restaurant,09/01/2021,"Yeay! I'm so happy finally visited one of the grandest hotels in Nusa Dua Bali. I want to tell about my experience when I entered Apurva Kempinski Bali. They have underwater hidden gems with natural and romantic vibes. This hotel is strategic location quite close to the airport only about 30 minutes, if you use a car via the toll road. When heading to the hotel, we will enter Jl. Raya Nusa Dua Selatan, Benoa, Kuta Selatan, Badung this are which is very beautiful, the setting is suitable for those who like the natural atmosphere. Arriving at the Apurva Kempinski Bali Gate Hotel, we were greeted by very friendly staff, the lobby was magnificent architecture and the view was really amazing cool because its directly faced the sea and we could also see the swimming pool from above‚Ä¶"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,Outstanding service !,09/01/2021,"Trust is earn not given, it is truly what we‚Äôve experienced during our stay in Apurva for the past 4 days. The service was right away spot on during the check in process for our Junior Cliff Suite, the front office officer - Setyawan was an outstanding hotelier ! He truly shown a great hospitality during the check in process and ensuring that my family needs and requirement are taken care of during our stay. We experienced an unfortunate situation where my wife left her mobile phone in the room upon check out and we just realized it several hours upon our departure. The service center staff - Ayu Sudarmi handled our call to ask for the missing mobile phone situation calmly and in proper manner, within minutes the hotel staff confirming that the mobile phone was indeed left in‚Ä¶"
The Apurva Kempinski Bali,"11/10. Amazing, personalised service. Great attention to detail, hygiene & safety during COVID.",09/01/2021,"I am a frequent visitor of Bali - allured by it's mystical and magical aura as well as the variety of activities suited for any type of traveler. Most of all, I love the warmth and friendliness of the Balinese & Indonesian people. No more is this more apparent than in The Apurva Kempinski Hotel - which combines a breathtaking property with surreal views, world class facilities and arguably the best hospitality I have ever experienced. Any hotel can take your breath away, especially in Bali where you have a long menu of exceptional properties to choose from - but it's the little things that matters and the service which, for me, puts Apurva in a league of their own. I'll give some examples. My wife drinks a lot of water, housekeeping picked up on this without us informing them‚Ä¶"

The Apurva Kempinski Bali,MEMORABLE HONEYMOON STAY,08/01/2021,"We booked The Apurva Kempinski Bali for our honeymoon and came with a very high expectation. Honestly, the experience was beyond what we had expected. First off we were greeted with a happy-honeymoon flower arrangement, cake, fruit, and champagne. (interestingly they provide us herbs for our honeymoon, namely ‚ÄúJamu Kuat for me and Sari Rapet for her‚Äù) lol. Amazing landscape, luxurious room, and amenities, topped with impeccable and extra personal service (most of the staff members greet you by name!).

I like the cleanness and ambience, also the view was pretty too! Served breakfast so well and foods are tasty tok! Will be back to hilton if i visit Bali again"
Hilton Bali Resort,No redeeming quality but the view.,10/01/2021,"Honestly appalling. Every single thing about the resort was horrible, the only saving grace is the view. First impression: the lady who checked us in seemed really inexperienced/undertrained. we had booked a room with executive lounge access, and she didn‚Äôt mentioned anything about it. Until we asked, which turned out the lounge was closed and we were only given 2 drinks voucher for the evening. Very disappointing, as if compared to ANY other hotel/resorts, an executive lounge will have full access all day for non-alcoholic drinks, and some food in certain time of day. When we asked if any food will be served along with the drinks, she said no and only drinks are offered. She did slip that they were ‚Äúcutting down‚Äù which I assumed due to the pandemic therefore I let it go. When‚Ä¶"

Hilton Bali Resort,Staff Training Lacking,08/01/2021,"Its very out of keeping for me to write a review that is less than glowing. After contacting their management and getting such a poor response, I felt the need to sadly. Let me start out with the positives: The 1 bedroom executive suites are fantastic - so well appointed, huge decks, amazing views - superb. The pool with the slides for the kids are fantastic The downside: Check in takes on average 1 hour every time we stayed which was 3 times over this past year. The food is terrible. The beach (unlike other hotels in Nusa Dua) isn't safe for swimming, is very steep and you can't do any Watersports or activities like cycling along the beach like other hotels which is a big disadvantage. Perhaps the biggest issue however is the staff training. During the pandemic, we‚Ä¶"

Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,Family Vacation on Uluwatu Cliff. Worth it to try!,10/01/2021,"Anantara Uluwatu is worth it to stay with family! Ocean view experience from the villa is amazing, also their 5 stars service. But cause of pandemic shutdown effect, lot of things still need detail maintenance. I hope this 5 stars hotel and all-Bali Tourism recovery soon! Oiya, you must see the sunset! Anantara have the best view I ever seen!"
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,Better stay at other hotel,09/01/2021,"We reached the hotel quite late due to some accident happened on our way there. We were quickly greeted by a very knowledgeable front desk officer. He explained everything very detailed. We booked 2 rooms and stayed for 3d2n. Hotel gave complimentary photo sessions for both rooms. Unfortunately since it is quite late, photo sessions were fully booked on the following day so our photo sessions were scheduled on the check out day. The only slot available was at 1pm and we were told that the photo result would only be available at 3pm. Because of that, we asked for late check out. The front desk informed us that they can only provide late check out at 3pm for one room which was fine with us. Then I asked the front desk to ensure that when we checked out at 3pm, the photo result‚Ä¶"
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,Great Resort and Service,10/01/2021,"Visited this amazing resort for a day and it was such an amazing experience. The 2 bedroom villas are super clean, the the staffs are kind and helpful. We also have our own small garden, pool, and living room, which is very convenient for a family. However, the stairs are unbelievable. Maybe it‚Äôs better to have a lift from the parking lot to the lobby. Despite of that, we will definitely come back again for another great stay."

Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,"Breathtaking ocean view from your suite, but noisy",09/01/2021,"We stayed at ocean view suite. Beautiful view and no obstruction view of the sunset. Small fishing boats in the horizon and surfers riding the small waves. You can also decent to the beach below with the elevator, operating in limited time in the afternoon during low tide. The jacuzzi on the balcony is a plus. The most downside is the suite is not sound proof at all. Can hear clearly the noises coming from the sound system in the next room, so annoying. We complained but only stop for a while. The suites boast with Bose sound system but room is not sound proof. And the noises from the suites below were also apparent. Breakfast at 360 is good especially the Western menu. The others restaurants : Sono Japanese Teppanyaki and Blue Bottle is just OK.. Waiters and staffs‚Ä¶"
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,5 x Star Service Level ( Staff Fantastic),09/01/2021,Fantastic Level of Service from Front Desk and Back Office Staff. 5 Stars. Especially Kadek Budiartha and Fafa. Thank you again. Looking forward to coming back soon with my family. ( By the way..if you surf or like watching ocean..Impossibles is right out front. Spectacular views of Bukit Peninsula.
Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort,A very pleasant relax hotel in Uluwatu,08/01/2021,"A cliffside, exclusive hotel in coastline of Uluwatu with serene atmosphere, amazing views to the ocean and spacious rooms fit for family or couple staycations. Hotel is most suitable for a laid-back, slow-paced and quiet retreat-like experience. I'd recommend at least spending two full days at the hotel to enjoy everything the hotel has to offer, as there are lots to see and do and it'd be the best way to get the most value out of the hotel. Rooms are also very comfortable and spacious, complete with very comfortable beddings as well. It is definitely a good idea to enjoy them as long as you can while you stay here. I won't recommend staying here if you're planning to go outside and about for most of the day because you'll be missing out on much that way."

Golden Tulip Jineng Resort,Good FAMILY HOTEL,10/01/2021,"Staying 3N here, good hotel, good open space and pool, luxurious, however this is very suitable for family, since there's lot of kids in the pool area. The breakfast is quite basic, and the room if still find some spot that not clean enough, when I arrived i need to call the housekeeping 2 times to make the room cleaner. The hotel also seems to reduce the cost, since in 3 nights I've stayed they never changed the hand sanitizer in the lift, so it always empty. But it's really recommended if you have family with kids to stay here"
Natya Resort Ubud,Beautiful forest view from the bedroom. True Ubud vibes.,08/01/2021,"We absolutely loved our stay at Natya, especially given how beautiful of a view you have from the bedroom overlooking the lush forest jungle. The bathtub was nice (and had enough hot water thankfully!) and it was beautiful to have a downstairs area to hang around by the pool. Didn‚Äôt use the private pool at all, as it was just a plunge pool, but it was a beautiful venue that was so serene, quiet, and enveloped in nature. The pool for all guests is stunning and overlooks into the forest as well, so I‚Äôll have to come back to use it!"

The Haven Bali,Poor condition and breakfast,10/01/2021,"It's 3 years since I last stayed in the Haven, my recollection was then it was a clean property well located near Jl double six and fairly priced. Unfortunately since that time the condition of the rooms has noticeably deteriorated. For our 2 night stay the premium room condition was shabby. The evening we arrived we noticed mosquitoes in the room so asked for the room to be sprayed, this was done promptly by housekeeping however when we returned from dinner 2 hrs later, while the mosquitoes were gone we found 5 large dead cockroaches on the floor. Next morning the standard and the quality of the breakfast it was clear had also gone down so much so that despite the room rate including breakfast we ate breakfast at another hotel on the second morning before leaving.

Mathis Lodge Amed,A perfect place for some mountain peace :),10/01/2021,Absolutely perfect place for coming with a partner. It's at the top of a mountain just a few minutes from Amed...though you'll probably want to spend all of your time here ;) Every detail in the rooms is beautifully designed and all of the small comforts are there that make you feel right at home. They have a nice communal / restaurant / pool area as well that is super comfortable where you could spend time if you don't get the private pool / jacuzzi rooms. They also have a shuttle up the 15 minute dirt road that I'd suggest taking especially if you're 2 people on a moto. Definitely will be back!
Mathis Lodge Amed,Dreamy.. the perfect venue,10/01/2021,"I visited with my partner last weekend and had the dreamiest stay. Everything about this venue has been beautiful done, with attention to detail in every fixture and item throughout the villas and restaurant. We stayed in the jacuzzi villa and enjoyed coffee with the most perfect views of mountains & ocean. I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough & hope to return soon. Definitely my favourite venue in Bali. Arrive early & don‚Äôt plan to leave until you have too.. because you will want to stay longer! Top tip.. the road up the hill is long & a dirt road, so take everything you need with you and plan to stay until you check out. They run a shuttle.. take the shuttle üôèü§ç"
Mathis Lodge Amed,Beautiful Place With Stunning Views,09/01/2021,"I went her with my girlfriend for her birthday and it did not disappoint! Its a beautiful resort with an African Safari Lodge theme, but with Balinese influences also! The manager Fr√©d√©ric was very helpful with arranging everything and was very hospitable during our stay! The view is absolutely stunning from where the resort is located, on a mountainside, a little outside of Amed. The rooms and the public areas within the resort are beautifully designed and all of the staff were helpful and friendly. The food and drinks were satisfactory, and of a reasonable price, for this type of resort. I would thoroughly recommend staying in such a beautifully designed and unique place!"
Mathis Lodge Amed,Epoustouflant !,09/01/2021,"il y a des endroits qui comme √ßa si vous avez la chance d'y √™tre, vous permettent de r√©aliser √† quel point Bali est magique. On se sent hors du monde et on contemple dans une s√©r√©nit√© absolue la vue f√©√©rique qui s'offre √† nous comme un cadeau des cieux. Pass√© l'aventure amusante de la mont√©e vers le Mathis Lodge en pickup avec Kadek, on se retrouve dans un endroit assez irr√©el ou les yeux ne savent plus ou donner. L'accueil de Fr√©d√©ric d√©s que l'on arrive au sommet vous fait penser que vous allez passer un s√©jour sp√©cial, et √ßa le fait. Le lobby et la piscine donnant une vue f√©√©rique sur la baie est simplement magnifique et quand on d√©couvre la suite, on a plus vraiment de mots. Tout est dans le d√©tail et savoir qu'on ne va y passer que 2 nuits seulement devient une‚Ä¶"

Mathis Lodge Amed,Dreamy and Unique,08/01/2021,"Mathis lodge is one of a kind, we had the jacuzzi suite and would highly recommend it. A great place to unwind and let go. Best sleep I‚Äôve had In years! When you‚Äôre done pondering life over the beautiful Amed mountains, you can head over the the gorgeous pool area and enjoy their generous food portions. If you are staying longer there are so many activities nearby line scuba and snorkelling or just hanging out by the ocean. The resort provides a shuttle service to and from the beach area an all staff is very helpful. You‚Äôll love the interior of the place and integration with nature around. Jacuzzi was the best one I‚Äôve ever used - an amazing treat when the sun goes down !"

Jambuluwuk Oceano Seminyak,Family Friendly Hotel in Seminyak,08/01/2021,"One of the best family-friendly hotels in Bali, and CHSE certified. Step into the lobby, we can see a beautiful elegant design mixed with contemporary design. We can also spot some photogenic spots around the lobby. My favorite one is the swing. I stayed at the premier pool view room. The room was nice, clean, and tidy. Spacious with a sofa, tv, and the bathroom equipped with a bathtub too. The bed and pillows were comfortable. Breakfast is served ala carte and we can choose whether we want them to be served to our room or dine in at their restaurant. We had an Indonesian and western-style breakfast along with a bread basket, fruit platters, tea, and milk for our daughter. My daughter really enjoys her day at the kids club. It has a colorful design with cute cloud shapes.‚Ä¶"
Kanvaz Village Resort Seminyak,Absolutely stunning hotel!!,10/01/2021,"Its a great art hotel with luxurious design, it was famous with the pattiserrie..

Kanvaz Village Resort Seminyak,"One of the most ""worth it"" hotel!",10/01/2021,"With their location, room, and service, this hotel is definitely worth every penny. I came back to this hotel recently after staying almost 8 nights back in June 2021. They definitely have improved. I can see breakfast is already buffet and they improved the amenities inside the room :) Room is as comfy as it used too, and service is just top notch. With the newly established patisseries right in front of the hotel, more reason to stay in this hotel! If you were like me, having a limited time in Bali, then this hotel is for you, no doubt! Most of the hyped places in Bali is within 10 minutes walk from this hotel. Revolver, Expat, Pison, Monsieur Spoon, Bodywork spa, Si Jin, Woobar, seasalt, Biku, and this list can go on."
Kanvaz Village Resort Seminyak,Nice,10/01/2021,"The location strategic, in Seminyak.

It was a wonderful moment to spend your time with your couples and celebrating moment at this hotel. Really love it. Don't hestitate to stay at KANVAZ."
Kanvaz Village Resort Seminyak,"Beauty in a ""Kanvaz""",08/01/2021,"Stayed here to celebrate our anniversary. It was a wonderful stay, especially for our toddler daughter who enjoyed the pool so much, which can be accessed directly from our room. We enjoyed the quietness so much during the pandemic (in a good way), not to mention almost every spot is a nice instagram spot (try the rooftop during the sunset). Love the design so much, it really describes the beauty in a ""Kanvaz"". I would highlight the staff's friendliness, especially Eka who was so playful to our daughter. Last but not least, we really enjoyed the super delicious special ""Anniversary"" greetings, which was one of the special menus from the Pastisseries. Will definitely come back."
Kanvaz Village Resort Seminyak,Wonderful stay,09/01/2021,"Excellent services , great breakfast, super clean room, and not to mention the friendly staff devi who was very welcoming and helpfull during our stay.

Grand Hyatt Bali,Love everything about this resort,10/01/2021,"Stayed here with 2 friends, they upgraded our room to a suite. Love the spacious bathroom with a big tub, 2 showers, and 2 toilets. We had a pond in our backyard. I personally love the breakfast the most, especially the pancake/waffle station. Ibu Dewi was really kind and helpful‚Äîall the staffs are angels though. And I love how they employed older people. If there‚Äôs anything to improve, I‚Äôd suggest fixing the concierge web chat. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs working."
Grand Hyatt Bali,Nice resort for family with kids,10/01/2021,"(+): the resort is kids friendly. Swimming pools are awesome & has 2 water slides, my kids super love it.

Grand Hyatt Bali,Amazing service,10/01/2021,I stayed in Hyatt Nusa Dua for 3 days and 2 nights. I booked a Grand room but they upgraded my room to Suite room which has kitchen and living room. Overall it was amazing service and hospitality. I will definitely stay here again
Grand Hyatt Bali,Perfect hotel to stay,10/01/2021,"Overall, I am highly satisfied with the service provided by Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua and I am looking forward to stay there again. Staffs are very friendly, kind and helpful. The best thing is, during this covid 19 pandemic, they provide the private clinic located down the lobby to do the antigen test and it is very helpful for the one who wants to fly with a plane because we are required to do antigen at least 1 x 24 hours before the flight. Also, the breakfast was delicious as expected, the room service was fabulous (my wife and I ordered burger and nasi goreng). In addition, the pool was amazing but unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have a chance to swim there because I only spent 3 days in Bali :( hopefully I‚Äôll be able to stay longer in grand hyatt nusa dua and try the fabulous swimming‚Ä¶"

Grand Hyatt Bali,Staff super ramah,09/01/2021,"Saya menginap disini 4 malam. Meskipun pandemi, peraturan disini tidak terlalu ketat yang malah membuat saya nyaman. Resepsionisnya sangat ramah. Kamar sangat bagus dan cocok untuk saya bekerja work from Bali juga. Istri saya sangat menikmat jalan2 area hotel dan pantai. Hanya saja waktu itu ketika main air di area pantai, ada bendera merah, jadi sedikit ada ubur2 kecil yang agak gatal. Tapi overall saya suka pantainya. Suka dengan ke ramahan semua orang dari pintu masuk sampai batas pantai. Salut! Love this! Hanya saja tidak sempat mencoba kolamnya karena katanya lg renovasi. Padahal salah satu kolam terbesar. Sarapannya sangat enak!"
Grand Hyatt Bali,Stunning!!,08/01/2021,"It was an easy decision for us to go back to Grand Hyatt Bali, we have stayed there numerous times and have always had an amazing time. It's definitely a family-friendly resort, where the kids can go out to play in the pool or beach, and the parent can just sit back and relax. The staff are very friendly and treat everyone with gentle care. I do want to give a shout out to Ms. Fenny, who have always been very helpful to me. Whether it was for a business trip or family vacation, she always help me and make sure to check on me, whether its a ""hi how are you"" or "" can I help you with anything else"", it really does makes a huge different to my overall experience. Thank you Hyatt!!"

We love the firm mattress, very good for our back. We were upgraded to suite room. We truly love it. We love that the room has working area and proper dining area. Lovely stay and love the beach. Could walk along the entire nusa dua beach Breakfast was really good. Healthy freshly squeezed fruits and vegetables juice. They were all delicious and sufficient varieties. We love that they have daily breakfast along with their classic ones. Really delicious! Would be better if some of the activities such as bicycles riding can be freely used by the guests. Think the guests need to pay hourly basis. Definitely recommended and would return!"
Grand Hyatt Bali,Excellent hospitality and service,08/01/2021,"The manager on duty was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The hotel was very nice. The female manager really helped us a lot, she made sure that our stay was unforgetable - in a good way. Thank you very much for your excellent hospitality."
Grand Hyatt Bali,Stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua,08/01/2021,We chose Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua because we had stayed there many times in the past. We had not been there for a while but found this time the place was still terrific. Staff provided outstanding service during a period of heightened covid exposure in Indonesia. Staff was wonderful and made it a highly enjoyable stay. We would certainly recommend it to anyone.
Grandmas Plus Hotel Airport,Best transit hotel close to the Ngurah Rai Airport,10/01/2021,"We stayed two nights in transit at this hotel during Covid-19 lockdown. Considering the pandemic that is raging at the moment, Bali tourism got hit the most. However, it was very uplifting to see the spirit of the hotel especially the staff in providing the best service value to the guest. The staff are the jewels of the property. Their smiles and graciousness were exemplary. I would like to especially mention Dhamma, Aussie, Komang, Kariati and Era as well as the night security staff whom I did not quite get the name. He was not only on guard as security but helped us with luggages as we arrived already late in the evening and he was the only one available. Well done...."
Grandmas Plus Hotel Airport,Nyaman,09/01/2021,"Lokasinya bagus, pinggir jalan. parkir motor tersedia di basement, jadi gak perlu worry kalo kepanasan.

The manager apologized and told us there's issues with the door that they need to fix. The manager gave us other room for us to freshen up while they prepare my actual room (which has been upgraded). Manager also gave us complimentary dinner to apologize so that's a good customer service. We went to dinner and when we're back, our actual room is ready. The rest is history!

Alila Seminyak,Nice oldie goldie property but questioning the readiness of the staffs to accept guest,10/01/2021,"Stayed one night before going back home. When arrived, noone, literally noone is there in the front area when your car is arrived at. Walked into the desk of reception, 3 young gentlemen were so busy looking at the screen in front of them, and not aware us arriving. I need to greet them first. Gave us an impression of: not ready to serve any guest? same with on the right side, 1 guy busy looking at screen. For us, first impression of the people serving is very important for the stay experience. The way those young gentlemen dressed are also not really up to the class. One with sleeves up, another one is down. Are Alila seminyak ready to serve professionally? I Only know during the day that the middle age lady is very accomodating and serving. And noone else like her. Passing‚Ä¶"
Alila Seminyak,They Serve With Heart!!,09/01/2021,"We stayed in Alila Seminyak for a night before going back to Jakarta. We had an amazing stay here, too bad that it was only for a night. I really love the simple interior they have, their cleanliness, their location, their view of the beach, their amenities (Not only smells great, but also I really really appreciate them for using the eco friendly packaging), oh and their pool too! They have 3 pools and if you're looking for the less crowded pool you can choose the ones on the L floor instead of the one next by the Beach Bar. Because in pandemic time, of course we are being extra careful for the hygiene, and this hotel meets our expectation. They also have a spacious gym, and a studio too. Would love to try the studio for dance practice or barre but sadly had no time. Asides‚Ä¶"

Alila Seminyak,Best in Seminyak,08/01/2021,It meets the expectations as I am a person with OCD. I intended to spot flaws on the corners and on areas that most people dont see. I even open the drainage in the bathtub to check if they cleaned it.

Anantara Seminyak Bali Resort,"Standart Anantara Seminyak,",10/01/2021,"Menginap 2 malam karena tertarik penawaran kamar ocean suite dan all you can eat sunset dinner hotel *5. Pesan langsung ke website hotel minta kamar the best view, sesuai gambar kamar website hotel yg dipesan, ttp yg didapat kamar 203 viewnya tdk bagus, beda jauh dengan gambar website hotel, terhalang dengan bangunan, pohon2 dll. Selain itu salah satu wastafel kamar mandi mampet tdk bisa digunakan. Tidak ada tempat sampah di kamar mandi. Sempat meminta opsi kamar lain, sayangnya kamar (303?) yg ditawarkan selain belum siap, posisinya juga sama saja hanya beda 1 lantai. Padahal saat itu sdh malam dan lapar.

Mercure Bali Legian,"Not perfect, but decent.",10/01/2021,"Stayed here for 5 nights and I had a nice experience. 1. Check-in process I actually arrived a few hours earlier from the check-in hours but my room was ready, probably because there weren't many guests staying at that time. My ALL benefit was easily recognized and fulfilled. Surprisingly I got complimentary of fresh slice fruits which is perfect for hot weather in Bali. 2. Room I was staying in Room 106, and the room is pretty standard with other Mercure branded hotel. Almost squeaky clean but the glass table already shown wear and tear. Size is decent for solo/couple, however for parents who travels with kids, you might want to consider a bigger room. I was expecting my room to be located in the high floor per my usual preference, but it's not a big deal, turns out the room‚Ä¶"
Mercure Bali Legian,Very limited voucher tu be used for Accor Member,08/01/2021,I stay for one night and want to use my upgrade room and free breakfast voucher.

I think there is miscom problem in the hotel frontline management. Very disappointed and very not recommended hotel for Accor member.

Sanctoo Suites & Villas,Amazing Experience,08/01/2021,"Pilihan yang tepat untuk staycation di Sanctoo. Mengapa? Karena pihak hotel terbukti sudah menjalankan semua prosedur protokol kesehatan. Mulai dari screening suhu tubuh hingga disinfektan kamar dan area public. Yang membuat terkesan adalah kamar diberikan stiker ‚ÄúRoom is Sanitized‚Äù sebagai tanda bahwa kamar hotel yang diberikan benar-benar steril. Kamar super bersih dan dilengkapi 2 masker. Kulkas mini bar. Yang membuat terkesan ialah pemandangan dari kaca kamarnya. Berasa Magic banget dan healing. Bukti: photo yang tanpa filter-filter. Saat breakfast pun semua sudah mengikutin standar protokol kesehatan dan meminimalisir resiko kontak dengan tamu lainnya. Meskipun ala carte, semua makanannya ENAK! Ga ada yang gagal, se-ENAK itu semua makanannya dan jusnya pun fresh. ‚Ä¶"

The room and public area are well maintained. Few inputs I had: - the linen need to be overlook as some of it have holes n tired. - parking lot are limited maybe when high occupancy of parking lot the hotel car could find alternative spot and make use of the space available for hotel guests - shades for kids pool Summary: we love the hotel and for sure will‚Ä¶"

Cause this was the second time here at Conrad Bali, we knew where we wanted to just relax and enjoy a good book. We choose to sit near the beach using a gazebo. We where greeted by the great staff. For lunch well we decided we wanted to keep it simple and western, so we ordered a pizza margherita, a smoothie mix of bananas and strawberries and a chocolate milkshake. The taste of the pizza really delicious, and the smoothie also very tasty. The chocolate milkshake, well I missed the soft ice cream. But still good enough to drink it all. The service was really‚Ä¶"

Staff are nice as always. 3. Breakfast and room services are okay. No complaints. 4. Before we came. We were told that dogs are only allowed in the room. They will not be allowed in common areas. But when we were there, people were bringing their dogs to the pool, and outdoor dining area. So we were eating in close proximity to slobbering dogs. Some dogs were urinating in the outside dining area. We are dog lovers too. But we certainly do not bring them to eat and swim with‚Ä¶"

I had dinner at The Kelusa by myself. The restaurant's staff and front desk have been amazingly helpful and kind to make sure I have everything that I need. I slept through the night on Samsara's amazing comfortable bed. When I wake up, it was drizzling rain and I decided to stay in bed and called the restaurant to have my breakfast delivered to my room.

I also got a flute as a souvenir, but sadly I don't know how to play it :( Another thing that I love about Samsara is the signature fragrance. I can smell it from the bath amenities, even from the hand spray. I hope that someday they will sell them as a merchandise. Thank you for all of the good time, Samsara.^-^"

And no one can peek to your outdoor area. So you got to enjoy it to the fullest. The super cool part is they have warmer for the private pool. Swimming at night, with the chill weather of Ubud, and warm pool all to yourself, it was just perfect for me and my spouse. All of the staff was also so friendly and helpful. From the reception desk, to restaurant waiters. I really enjoyed my time in Samsara and you should too."

Sadara Boutique Beach Resort Bali,"Beautiful Rooms, Lush Gardens, Perfect Service, Amazing View",08/01/2021,"I booked a night here in August just because I wanted to get away from Kerobokan and needed a break. Tanjung Benoa is so quiet now and I thought I could do my part in supporting Bali's tourism, no matter how small. Anyway, I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. Everything was great. The staff members were friendly and helpful, the room was perfect and clean with a very comfortable bed, sofa and chairs, very cold AC, and a lovely terrace with a garden view. I really loved the garden. I would sit under the big tree with my laptop and watch the birds fly by. I also liked the restaurant and the sea view. The pool was also really good - the water was fresh and clean and did not hurt my eyes. So all in all, I give this hotel 10/10. I would love to stay again someday. Thank‚Ä¶"

Everyone we came across in the hotel were super nice. It's the most worthit hotel we've stayed in. The manager Yuli was very professional, she helped us solved our problem with the traffic polices. They came to us just right after I called which I didn't expect. During our stay, we used the hotel car rental service. We had a nice trip with Veda who drove us around. He was a good driver and a very nice fun person to have conversations with. We felt like we made a friend in our trip. Thanks to him we had some knowledges of local culture now. Usually I would consider staying in hotels would lose connection with the local people. This hotel changed my‚Ä¶"

W Bali - Seminyak,WORST service EVER‚Ä¶ WORST.. EVER..,10/01/2021,"Dear W Hotel, please please fix your service.. This is the first time I feel so stressful booking a hotel, even before staying at the hotel. Truly just experienced the WORST service ever in my life. Booked the hotel early september, we stayed at several hotels including Mulia, Como, Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons. In the middle of the trip, our family caught Covid19 so we have to stop the trip..

The main pool was big, they also have gym with decent equipments. Bar on 2nd floor, nice to have an afternoon drink. Breakfast was yummy. I tried their floating breakfast at my private pool. Afternoon tea was also splendid. Beware of the monkeys though as the location is near the Monkey Forest. Never let your room left open."

Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Jewel In Sideman's Crown,10/01/2021,"I don‚Äôt know where to start. I am a very fussy traveler and being in the hotel industry I pick up on very small details. Samanvaya was faultless. It is so clear to be that this place is so loved. Not only are the staff incredibly happy and so well trained but the maintenance, fixtures, fittings and details are perfectly formed. The spa is world class with innovative treatments I recommend the heavenly romance package. The room was divine with two balconies looking out of the organic gardens to the ocean beyond and surrounded by hills. The bed was super soft and we had the best sleeps we have had in years. Going to sleep with the sound of nature it was so peaceful. The hot tub, the pools, all the pool cabanas to relax in and so many peaceful nooks to just curl up and read‚Ä¶"
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,One of the best stay ever,10/01/2021,We stayed in Samanvaya almost one week and we felt so comfortable there. The Staff is very helpful and reliable. Also the Spa there is very very good. The massage lady Aliya is a really nice person and her skills are incredible. Also the food was very very delicious and the rooms have been just so nice and added with nice little details. We will definately come back again and enjoy an other stay with samanvaya. Terima kasih banyak.

The spa and restaurant exceeded our expectations. The resort gave us such a good feeling of well being we can't wait to visit again."
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,A relaxing break surrounded by greenery,09/01/2021,"We have just spent 2 nights at the hotel, staying in a lumbung style room. The room allowed for privacy and it came with great views across the valley. What you have to remember is that the lumbung‚Äôs are made of bamboo and alangalang, so there is not much sound proofing. It was not an issue as the hotel was not full. However on our 2nd night the couple next door had a blazing argument and it was as if they were in our room (not the hotels fault that they have disrespectful guests). The bed was so comfy and we both slept really well. The hotel provide you with a mobile in your room so you can whatsapp reception if you require anything while you are at the hotel. So each morning we would send a message about what we would like for breakfast and at what time. It was‚Ä¶"
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,"Beautiful Area, Heavenly Spa, Unsatisfying Overall Hotel Experience",09/01/2021,I'll start with the good: 1. The area - being able to walk or bicycle around Sideman was really amazing! Definitely take your bike to the surrounding waterfalls and take a walk down to the rice fields from the resort. 2. The Spa - Easily the best spa experience of my life. My girlfriend and I got the 90-min body wrap and it was so insanely relaxing. The spa is absolutely 5-star! 3. Bed - the bed was really comfy and we slept like babies. The Bad: 1. The food - we had heard from a friend that the food was not good when they came so we ate out for lunch and then for dinner just had a small snack. Both my girlfriend and I are vegan and the first dish that we ordered came to our room and included a side with egg in it. This was after specifying with the hotel staff multiple‚Ä¶
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Beautiful weekend getaway,08/01/2021,The staff pampers you with breakfast on your own balcony and bringing anything you might need right to your room within minutes.

Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Serene and fresh air,08/01/2021,"We came based on pasy reviews and very pleased with our stay. This place is so serene, the air is so pure and fresh, we sleep with the window open. The restaurant serves delicious meals, all the dishes that we tried are worthy of Michellin Star. Staffs are warm and helpful. Will come back in the future for sure."
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Beautiful Escape in the mountains,08/01/2021,"From arrival to departure, each moment of our stay was magic. Set upon a hillside in Sideman, you can watch the sunset + sunrise from your bed - with the folding doors wide one. Frogs and geckos create the soundtrack as you laze around the two pools, sipping on cocktails or green juice. The food is beyond phenomenal. A huge NZ influence on the menu - and every meal was outstanding. Favourites was the gnocci + fish tacos. Ogik and Langkir were the absolute friendliest hosts who looked after us so well at every meal. We will be back there for sure!"
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,It rained the whole time AND IT WAS AMAZING,08/01/2021,"Spent a few days here last week with my girlfriend and I have to say it was amazing. The location is beautiful, the service is great and the food is incredible. We had a couples massage at the spa and I was super impressed with the therapists. Yes it rained the whole time so we didn't go far from the resort but it was super cozy listening to the rain from our room. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be returning."
Samanvaya Luxury Resort & Spa - Adults Only,Amazing Stay at Samanvaya,08/01/2021,"Stayed a couple of nights at Samanvaya and had the most relaxing time! Just what I needed for a little break from work. It was raining most of the time when I was there but it doesn't reduce my experience at all. I even loved the rain and the chill vibes. My favorite was waking up in the morning opening the blind to the beautiful hills view. A perfect way to start the day. Another highlight was their food at the Asri Dining.. OMG... every single meal I tried was mouthwatering.... food were delicious across the menu, from breakfast, lunch and dinner, always looking forward when it's meal time. Must try! I highly recommend Samanvaya if you want to escape to east Bali! Must go!"

Adiwana Bisma,Lovely family stay in central Ubud,09/01/2021,We booked 2 nights in this resort . However we extended for another 2 nights since we loved the team and the rooms . The pool has an amazing view overlooking the river and the jungle. It was very relaxing for us with 2 kids. The hotel is very close to the center of ubud with plenty of restaurant options. The food in pistachio restaurant was also great . Only downside was that breakfast was a bit slow . But we understand that during covid the social distancing might effect this. Would definitely recommend
Adiwana Bisma,Really love this place!!!,10/01/2021,Everything about this hotel blows my mind! The place is really relaxing and would be perfect if you are searching for a place to just chill and enjoy the vibes. The service is immaculate and really helpful.

Loved the views at the restaurant of the rice fields.

Staff were exceptionally helpful and courteous, while maintaining safe social distances and observing important COVID-19 protocols. We loved all of our meals at the Octagon restaurant, the afternoon tea, and the picnic lunch they prepared for us. The menu had fantastic options both from its Western and Indonesian sides, and we were surprised that they were able to offer a full menu despite what we assumed to be low occupancy rates. In the end, the only effect that we noticed was that we had the staff's undivided attention, and felt very well looked after. Our room was wonderful as well - designed in a cabin style, but equipped with a comfy A/C, strong wi-fi, and a TV so we didn't‚Ä¶"

Thank‚Äôs to Mr. Putu and mbak Sri for the hospitality, and Mr. Bimbi, we had a great talk that morning. I‚Äôm sure you can make it even better and better. I can‚Äôt wait to go back again with my children, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre gonna love it.

Plataran Menjangan Resort & Spa,Tikus jam 4 pagi..,09/01/2021,Gimana rasanya kalau pas lg enak tidur digerayangin tikus d lengan atas deket sm muka? dan kebangun melihat tikus depan muka mu?

Padahal konsepnya keren banget dan view nya bagus banget.. Lobby dan staf nya jg baik.. driver/ranger pak Kadek yg ajak kami keliling tour sangat baik.. Tp itu semua tidak menghapus pengalaman buruk kami digerayangin tikus jam 4 pagi...

Bed & Breakfast Aquaterrace,Great stay at Bunutan area,09/01/2021,"Note that this is in the bunutan area, near japanese shipwreck and 20minutes from amed centre.

Hill and Ocean that are on seperated buildings just about 50m apart. We stayed at the Terrace Hill room 2nd floor, the biggest one with a bathtub, on the hillside but very much had a lovely wide view of the ocean. Room was big and clean with minibar, kettle, toiletries using sensatia botanical. Windows at the bathroom was not cleaned from outside, maybe missed that. If only, a tv would be nice when staycation-ing. AC would have been better if put at the back. Opening the doors at nighy was not an option, since there was a cat that likes to hang out‚Ä¶"

I always learn something new and receive helpful feedback on what I did well and what to improve on every dive, and was given just the right balance of independence and help. It was a really fun learning experience, and definitely makes me want to explore and learn more!

"Capella Ubud, Bali",Beautiful surroundings and a unique experience,09/01/2021,"We enjoyed a quick one night stay at The Photographer's tent at Capella Ubud and it was incredible. It was our first Bill Bensley experience and the level of detailing on decor in our tent and the entire resort was amazing. The morning view from our private pool and balcony overlooking the rainforest valley carved by the Wos River provided such a peaceful way to start off the day. The Spa massage was one of the best we had, and the genuine service from the talented team truly made us feel like royalty during our couples getaway. Will hope to be back to explore more and ""recharge our batteries"" again."

I was kindly offered to visit one of their tents, which I accepted with great pleasure. The inside of the tents is just beautiful, it's very warm, the materials are of very good quality. I recommend choosing a tent with a view of the valley, it is really beautiful, I can't wait to stay there."

Grand Mirage Resort & Thalasso Spa - Bali,Worst customer service I‚Äôve ever received.,09/01/2021,"We booked this hotel for our 10 year anniversary for 2020 and we‚Äôre not able to go due to the shut down of Bali and restrictions into Indonesia. The hotel refused to refund our hotel and instead gave us a further two years to rebook. It is now September 2021, it‚Äôs been 2 years and we still can‚Äôt go as there are restrictions and we were made redundant from our jobs. We humbly requested that the hotel do as many airlines and hotels have and refund us as we haven‚Äôt been able to make it this far and are in a difficult financial situation to come in the near future. The hotel agreed on only a 50% refund of $5000 and I thought this was unreasonable especially as hotels and airlines around the world are refunding due to the pandemic being no fault of ours and more the countries locked‚Ä¶"
Grand Inna Kuta,murah di masa pandemi,10/01/2021,"menginap di hotel ini semalam setelah tiba dari surabaya di sore hari. kamar masih cukup terawat, harga pandemi sangat murah, tidak sampai 300k. padahal sebelum pandemi sempat menginap di hotel ini diatas 1jt untuk jenis kamar yang sama. hotel sudah cukup ramai, menerapkan protokol kesehatan cukup baik. makan pagi hampir semua meja penuh terisi. makan buffet, namun diambilkan oleh pegawai hotel. Dari area makan pagi ada akses langsung ke pantai, namun ramai penjual/jasa pijat, sehingga kurang nyaman."

Grand Inna Kuta,Review singkat,09/01/2021,"Sya menginap disini slma pandemi, di deluxe with sea view dan deluxe room. Dari segi harga, harga termasuk murah utk hotel sekelas ini, apalagi posisi hotel tepat didepan pintu masuk kota, dan tmpt breakfastnya menghadap lgsg ke pantai kuta. Utk stafnya ramah2. Interiornya cukup bagus, tidak terlalu mewah, sama spt interior hotel lain. Bangunannya sih sprtnya udh cukup tua. Utk kamar deluxe with sea view dan deluxe room, menurut saya interiornya dan fasilitas sama persis yg membedakan hanya view lautannya saja. Klo mencari hotel yg menghadap lgsg ke pantai kuta, tempat ini bisa dicoba."

Amnaya Resort Kuta,Hidden gem di Kuta,10/01/2021,"Aku menginap 2 kali di waktu yang berbeda dan mengambil kamar yang paling murah. Saking sukanya sama hotel ini, aku mau mengulas dengan detail (sayangnya lagi nggak bisa simpan foto jadi nggak bisa melampirkan foto apapun disini) Pertama, walau letak hotelnya di jalan yang sempit, tapi lokasinya sangat strategis. Tinggal jalan sedikit, sangat dekat mall Discovery, pantai, bandara, waterbom. Mungkin karena pandemi, jadi banyak toko dan resto yang tutup. Kalau ingin ke tempat makan yang lumayan banyak yang buka, Kuta Square juga bisa ditempuh beberapa meter saja. Tapi overall lokasinya sangat menjanjikan. Kedua, pelayanannya sangat memuaskan. Walau staf terbatas, tapi mereka sangat profesional dan ramah ke semua tamunya. Mulai dari satpam, resepsionis, yang bagian membersihkan‚Ä¶"

Whenever I travel to a place the most important thing to me is the people. I'm all about making connections, building relationships. Because it is the key to happiness. And that exactly what I found at Amnaya Resort Kuta. Yoga, the resort manager, and every single one of his staff meant it when they greeted and asked me,""Selamat pagi, Pak Yesa! Apa kabar?"". How could I tell if they're being sincere? Because I would take them up on it and engage them in conversations that could last up to 15 minutes (yeah, I can be‚Ä¶"

Amnaya Resort Kuta,4 star hotel that incredibly feels like 5 star hotel.,09/01/2021,"During this hard time, hotels (specially in Bali) reduce their employees. I‚Äôve been to 5 star hotels in Bali that have more employee, but I‚Äôve never felt so much welcomed like in Amnaya. Their hospitality is beyond my expectation for 4 star hotel. I have no complaints at all. We reaaaally really love the layout of the bedroom, we had it connecting to our nanny‚Äôs bedroom. It‚Äôs spacious & nice. I feel very comfortable staying at Amnaya. Love every details, looks like they‚Äôre very thoughtful about every single thing. That really makes me enjoy my holiday with my family to the fullest.

Kami menyetujuinya dan mendapatkan kamar di pinggir kolam renang. Interior kamar persis dengan Amnaya Benoa, tetapi Amnaya Benoa terlihat lebih baru. Ada bath tub terpisah, di dalam shower hanya ada rain shower. Selama dua malam di Amnaya Kuta, selalu ada beberapa ekor nyamuk. Mungkin karena kamar kami dekat dengan kolam renang serta pepohonan kecil. Saat kami tinggal di sana, SPA sedang tutup karena PPKM. Overall, kami senang tinggal di Amnaya Kuta."

Surprisingly their quality of service is even upgraded during this hard situation. The staff were so humble and friendly. They help me to find best room, even offered me to upgrade my room. Really another great stay there, where I really enjoyed the clean spacious room with nice bath tub in it. As an architect my self, I should give applause to the designer of the bed room. It's really good looking and hommy. The room with pool access was the best. Try to spend your morning coffee at the terrace under there tree shade and pool view.

Sheraton Bali Kuta Resort,Very Recommended Hotel in Kuta Area,10/01/2021,"The rooms are very good and well maintained, the check-in process is also very easy and without problems. Our room was upgraded with a beautiful beach view. For breakfast according to 5-star hotel standards, it's just that the variety is a bit lacking. For the service of all hotel staff, it's very good, it's just that the front lobby staff slightly differentiates the car park according to the type of car :) because we used a cheap rental car, we asked to park a bit far away, while behind us there was a more expensive car that could be parked right in front lobby."

Our Indigo representative solved all our problems by booking us an extended stay in a beautiful villa fully equipped with all of our wants and needs including a PS4!

They really look after you here, more that just a guest and take care of you like family. Melali is a beautiful place to stay and experience surrounding beaches and cafes but what sets Melali apart from other accomodation is the personal touch and energy the owners bring to your stay away from home. I love the morning light and surrounding lush nature, the epic breakfast and the just chilling in and around the pool with nothing to do but chillax all day long if you choose too."

Everything is designed to help you capture everything that Bali has to offer and delight every one of your senses.

My husband was to tall to shower and to tall for the bath. Water doesn't get hot and the plug didn't work so the water runs out quickly, enamel comes off in the tub. They have these beautiful cabanas on the beach that don't allow children. Also you have to pay extra if you want the privilege of using it. Pretty ridiculous considering that there was no one around.

Amertha Bali Villas,Dirty cutlery,09/01/2021,"We stayed last week at Amertha just for one night. The villa was beautiful, had a beautiful view, gardens were impeccable. Sadly restaurants were closed because of the pandemic. So the breakfast was nothing much to talk about. The worst part of this trip was a knife which still had food stains on it. Made me go all yuck! Although it was good value for money we felt that a place which did not focus on cleanliness is not really visiting."

TV di ruang tengah sangat besar.. serasa di rumah.. Sedikit masukan hanya utk wifi.. utk youtube-an dr TV hotel, sinyal sangat lancar.. tp wifi utk ke HP dan laptop sangat susah.. sdh bbrp kali didatangi teknisi, namun sinyal bagus hanya bertahan 5-10 menit setelah kedatangan teknisi.. setelah itu hilang lagi.."

Amarterra Villas Bali Nusa Dua - MGallery,Amarterra Villa - 4*s for me,09/01/2021,"We went here for a short stay for 2 nights at Amazonian 3 - 2bedrooms pool villa. The villa itself is spacious with a complete amenities. + Location is great, you can never find bad hotel and villa in Nusa Dua area especially in ITDC Bali area. + Spacious villa and clean pool + Food was really delicious, especially the one made by Chef Made Bagus. It was a great experience to enjoy his hospitality and food made by him! + There is one staff we met from Social Media marketing named Putri - also very attentive and show us around the spot. Thumbs up! - TVs channel selection! Only local channel? Not more than 20 selections? - Understaffed? This was my assumption because I would expect prompt response on queries - Not a big fan of main bathroom curtain / blind selection"
Amarterra Villas Bali Nusa Dua - MGallery,Decent Villa in Nusa Dua,08/01/2021,"Overall the Villas are nice and the staff are very helpful and attentive. Special thank to pak Komang, pak Julian and pak Aslan who have help me during my stay to fix many things. The team have done a great job to make my stay become enjoyable. The only draw back that need to be improved is the water as somehow the tap water has some taste like salty and like brakish water, so do do not feel good when brushing your teeth or when showering as well. According to them, it comes from PDAM which I am not quite sure as the other hotel in Nusa Dua does not have that issue, because prior to staying in Amarterra, I was staying in another hotel which is only 600 meter away and I did not have the water issue. Other than this water issue, everything else is great."

We were greeted at the front and escorted to reception and we were checked in by Aslan (who we had met previously) who was excited to see us back and explained the current operations of the hotel.

We came for Ubud Writers Festival, which was located only about 200m down the way and very close to the centre of ubud and all restaurants etc. Staff were superb with excellent English and gave us a free 1 hour trek along rice padi and views across the valley - so nice.

Mulia Resort,Unpleasant experience,10/01/2021,"1. We booked for double bed, but they gave us twin bed. We need to complain first then they will try to find the replacement room. 2. There‚Äôs no clear signage inside the resort. It‚Äôs confusing to find a way. 3. Some staffs are nice and kind, but others are below 5 stars standard 4. There‚Äôs regulation that men can‚Äôt use tank top inside the restaurant. Idk what is the reason. Body odor? If yes, then why they allowed women to use it. Even women can use tank top, hot pants, crop top, etc. 5. Wifi only limited to 3 devices. As you might now, nowadays people can have more than 2 devices. What kind of regulation is that? Even most of cheap hotel and villa doesn‚Äôt limit their wifi like that. Ridiculous. (The speed of their wifi also terrible)"

Mulia Resort,Memorable stay ever,10/01/2021,"One of our best stay in Bali. Room size was 5 stars hotel standard but very clean and tidy, big fridge, closet equipped with Toto Washlet. The view from lobby was mesmerizing overlooking to the ocean with plenty of greeneries. All the staffs have remarkable skill and world class services. Special appreciation to Pak Edy from the beach bar who has been a good company and told us lots of things to maximize our stay in the property. I guess Mulia has scaled down their breakfast buffet standard but still maintain a decent quality of food. We are not a big eater, so we don't really mind. Enjoy lunch at Soleil and Ala Carte dinner at The Cafe. Oxtail soup and the grill salmon was the highlight. Well done Mulia. You deserve all the world awards of hospitality."
Mulia Resort,Love it!,09/01/2021,"This was my second stay at Mulia Bali. My family and I were very satisfied and happy with our experience here. The check in took quite a while but it maybe because of my travel agent booked the wrong date, but the hotel staff gave us complimentary beverages while waiting so that was very nice of them. My kids had so much fun at the kids club & the pool. The breakfast was spectacular and they had a very good safety protocol. I even came back twice for dinner at the cafe. I stayed at 5 different 5-stars hotels on this trip but I can say that I like Mulia the best. All the staffs are well trained and they gave the best hospitality. Would definitely come back :)"

Very beautiful resort indeed. All the staff is also very kind, helpful and attentive. We joined some activities prepared by the hotel, such as water aerobic and canoeing. The aerobic was so much fun, but canoe will cost you since they need to engage with the third party vendor. Hope they can prepare the canoe or paddleboard on the house so the guest doesn't need to pay extra as the hotel price is already quite high. When we stayed, the hotel was very empty due to pandemics, but on the plus side we can enjoy everything without worried and we can even have the pool and beach only for ourselves! We hope that we can stay longer and joined other‚Ä¶"

"The Stones Hotel - Legian Bali, Autograph Collection","Nice, clean",10/01/2021,"Spacious bedroom, very clean and neat. Bath area is a different story. I hate their shower knob. It's not user friendly especially for muslim because if you turn the knob too far right to stop the hand shower, the one on the ceiling start to pour all over you. We usually use shower to take wudlu with our clothes on so this would be a disaster. Happened to me the first time using it. Breakfast was excellent."
"The Stones Hotel - Legian Bali, Autograph Collection",Could have been better,10/01/2021,"There were drawbacks in the room, some rusts and stains. However, this was quickly dealt with when we raised the matter to the front desk. One main problem is that there was no running hot water. They used solar panel which depends on how sunny that day was. Shower was cold even in the afternoon on some days. The great thing is the staffs attentiveness and attitude. They were helpful in terms of doing what they can in addressing the above and made the rest of our stay better."

Hevea Villas,Just what we need for our little break from the new normal,09/01/2021,"After 3 days of road trip from Jakarta, arriving to Hevea Villa was so so so worth it. We were extremely happy to have found this villa. We stayed for 5 nights at Villa #2, it's a two bedroom villa. What really sold me about this villa is the connecting door between the bedrooms. I have a 9yo and 8yo, and the connecting door really gave me a piece of mind at night. I looked at other 2 bedroom villas, but the bedrooms are just separated too far for my liking, while a 1 bedroom is just too small for the four of us. The swimming pool was quite big, the kids reallly had a good time swimming there, me & my husband included! The villa was very clean, and I like how they thought of providing little cloth and disinfectant in every room, makes cleaning easier. They also provided‚Ä¶"

Kuta Seaview Boutique Resort,Best one I've been to,09/01/2021,"The place is close to the place called beachwalk where you can fulfill all your shopping needs. Comfy bed, tidy room. good service, and also good food too. And don't forget the good,old, bali hospitality."
Kuta Seaview Boutique Resort,Kuta seaview hotel,09/01/2021,"The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was spacious and clean. The vintage aesthetics were awesome.

Kamaniiya Petitenget Seminyak,"Worht it, but a little less ordinary !",10/01/2021,"Just telling the truth, from the first check in until morning bfast we have been handled by trainee team . It was super amazing, even they‚Äôre a trainee but they‚Äôre looks so professional to be at our service, especially the trainee at the front desk who handled us during check in last night . Sadly to said, the bfast a bit dissapointed us . There‚Äôs no any selection menu, just 1 set course without any bread or selection egg style . But, overall the rooms and amenities was really good . Ok the last one concerned, the thread mill doesn‚Äôt work properly and the gym has very limited facilities . Keep up the good work all Kamaniiya team !"
Kamaniiya Petitenget Seminyak,The location is perfect base to start Balinese island experience,08/01/2021,"I stayed in this hotel a while ago before hotel change the name into Kamaniiya, this time we still amaze with their service, we book 2 rooms for me and my parent, they offer me free upgrade with connecting and late check out, rooms are very clean and smells good. Location is just perfect to start our island experience, we will come back again !"
Bali Silent Retreat,Heaven!,08/01/2021,"it is the Silence that heals. the location is its vessel and what a vessel it is. at the foot of Mount Batu Karu with rice fields as far as the eye can see. bordering a sliver of tropical forest right down to the river. BSR sits right between, on holy grounds where healing has always happened from times past. the food its fuel, the most luxurious fuel I have ever had. vegan, grown at BSR of otherwise responsibly sourced. mealtimes are announced by a wooden gong and it will become the anchoring point in this place where time stands still. the room is a sanctuary. simple but clean with 100% cotton sheets. but the Silence is what BSR is for. calming, detoxifying, centering...a rest we all deserve. hint: read the website carefully, it is a wealth of information."
Bali Eco Stay Bungalows,The most sustainable stay in Bali,10/01/2021,"We had a lovely 5 night stay in Bali Eco Villas, surrounded by nature, waterfalls, rivers and the jungle! The beautiful jungle soundtrack at night is mesmerizing and the food cooked freshly in the restaurant comes straight from the permaculture gardens on site. We took a tour through all of the gardens and down to the private waterfall on site where you can have a private picnic made for you. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here, the staff were friendly and helpful and organized massages, picnics, walks and local knowledge about the area. We'll be back again soon we hope!"
Bali Eco Stay Bungalows,The REAL Bali experience,10/01/2021,"My absolute favoutire place to stay in Bali, a short (beautiful and scenic) drive from Bali's main tourist centre is an amazing little paradise. We chose to stay here as they have strong beliefs set within the environment and the resort is nestled within the jungle and rice paddie fields. We enjoyed the private waterfall on-site which also powers almost the entire resort! Come and stay here if you really want to turn off, wind down and really experience the raw, beautiful nature and environment of Bali. Highly recommend the salad and harvest bowls, like the rest of the menu, everything is hand picked from the gardens the morning you order it! Be sure to take a tour of the gardens and river to learn all about the permaculture they've set up. We had such a fantastic stay‚Ä¶"
Bali Eco Stay Bungalows,Perfect staycation to reconnect to Nature,10/01/2021,"I had a lovely weekend at Bali Eco Stay ! It‚Äôs located in the middle of nature and perfect to reconnect and reset. The place is cradled by nature which makes it so unique. The staff is very welcoming and the feed soooo delicious (they have their own food garden !!). The whole resort is an experience itself where you can stay, enjoy the waterfall but also some nice walks. Highly recommend !!"
Bali Eco Stay Bungalows,a great get away from the busy Kuta.,08/01/2021,This is nature at its best. Each cottage is nestled away by its self. You can just feel to craftsmanship that went into building theses spacious wood villas. The natural air flow is all you need to stay comfortable day and night. lets not forget about the surrounding area. Be sure to take one of the nature walks and drink in the breath taking rice fields and waterfalls. There are plenty of activities to partake in. The restaurant and staff provide a wonderful menu of western and local dishes. Another impressive note is they produce most of there own food and clean energy. This aia a place I will return to and bring friends.
Kokonut Suites,They trap you,10/01/2021,"The housekeeping was lazy, the management didnt even bother to check their work. I stayed here for 2 weeks, they tried to charge me for 4 bath towels and 3 hand towels on the last day 1 bath towel and 1 hand towel had makeup stain, which CAN BE REMOVED INSTANTLY WITH WATER. ( I REMOVED ALL THE STAINS IN 2 MINUTES ) but they said they checked and they couldnt remove it. Which they lied. Because when i confronted the housekeeping and ask how they checked, and he didnt answer me. Which really left me wonder, how do they clean their towels and bed linens. Do they even use water/soap/bleach???? The rest of the towel was not stained. Yet they are charging me for it. They showed me their towels, which are dirty and have brownish stained to even begin with. Hello, you didnt have‚Ä¶"
Kokonut Suites,Feels Like Home...,09/01/2021,"this is our first stay ath the suites. It was superbly amazing. The location, the staff, the room (this is outstanding) the facilities are two thumbs up. Great place for routine escape. Close to many restaurant, groceries store. We stay here with our family. Two bed room suite are great. Larga living room, dinind area and theres a working table too. Well, you still need a place to hangout with your laptop right? The kitchen was fullset with stove, water heater, fridge, microwave. Just like i said, Feels like home... we cook, eat, swim and repeat for three days. The kids love to stay there. in fact, they already request to stay there again. HIGHLY recommended...."
The Royal Beach Seminyak Bali - MGallery,A unique kind of experience,10/01/2021,"The Royal Beach Seminyak (RBS) will be always a unique place to stay. Most properties in Bali these days have lost touch of traditional architecture style, they are too modern for my taste. However, RBS managed to keep the Balinese authenticity from the exterior, interior, and more importantly the warm smiles from all the staffs (I can feel it although they‚Äôre wearing masks). 1) Reception Super easy, no hassle, the staff explains everything about the property, the surroundings, and the available facilities. They also tried to manage my expectations that services will be limited due to Level 3 of Covid restrictions, and I totally understand that. 2) Room I was staying for 3 nights in a villa unit 102. The room is huge, plenty of room, with a royal style bathtub, private pool,‚Ä¶"
The Royal Beach Seminyak Bali - MGallery,Comfortable room great Location,09/01/2021,"Rooms were comfortable with direct access to the beach, Relaxing by the beach every afternoon waiting for sunset, friendly local merchant in front of the hotel (Pak Wayan & his wife) We were a bit shocked when first entering the front area/main building which was abandoned but on the back/ villa areas was pretty well maintained including the main pool. The villa needs to be updated especially the outdoor area e.g. decking, outdoor furniture, However everything else was smooth. Air con was cold, hot water running well, room were clean Hope they will be back again stronger."
The Royal Beach Seminyak Bali - MGallery,Royal Beach should become Disaster Beach,09/01/2021,Booked a quick staycation at Royal Beach...somewhere I haven‚Äôt stayed for about 6 years. All good they sent me the confirmation saying my Amex had been charged and was not refundable and in order to check in I needed to provide a fully vaccinated certificate (which I am not due to medical reasons). After a bit of a discussion and proof I had attempted vaccination they agreed to a negative PCR test. Checked in and no mention of the proof from either of us. Villa wasnt ready to went and had coffee there and they called to tell us when we could go to the villa as we already had the key. The hotel looks very old and tired and slightly rundown in dire need of renovation. The villa was ocean front and view however there was a wall at the front . From inside the villa if you wanted to‚Ä¶
The Royal Beach Seminyak Bali - MGallery,Perfectly located paradise,08/01/2021,"This excellently located resort is simply amazing although needing some touch up. The hotel was kind enough to upgrade me to the beachfront suite which comes with its own jacuzzi and chilling gazebo which overlooks into the sea. The staff are super welcoming and friendly, they made the stay during the pandemic into a paradise and I ended up extending the stay. The hotel has one of the best location in Seminyak and direct beach access to view the perfect sunset. Thank you for an amazing stay!"
Peppers Seminyak,"Central location, attentive employee, but need to work on cleanliness",10/01/2021,"Peppers located in Petitenget, centrally located to all the fun things in Seminyak. Stayed at their 3 bedroom presidential villa for 2 nights. It is a huge villa with separated communal area and kitchen perfect for families. They have huge dining table fit for 8 person, which can be use as a WFB spot. They got wifi, standard speed, enough for 1 video conferencing meeting, but not 2 simultaneously. Rooms are big, with comfortable beds. The villa concept is modern balinese, somewhat romantic style, where bathroom are designed in open concept. They have outdoor and indoor showers as well as bath tub and separated toilet area. good health protocol upon check in where they asked our antigen results However, pandemic really hit them hard, where maybe, the villa where I stayed‚Ä¶"
Joe's Diving Bali - Dive Castle - Tauchburg,"Great dive centre, would highly recommend!",10/01/2021,"Myself and three friends recently completed our SSI open water certificate through Joe‚Äôs Diving Bali. The full experience from start to finish was absolutely amazing! Martin, the dive instructor, was very knowledgeable, relaxed, and had a great sense of humour! The facilities were perfect for learning how to dive and we were provided with well-kept equipment for all of the dives and activities. The price was very reasonable considering the amount that was included in course. If you are looking to complete your open water certificates or simply looking for a centre to take some dives with, I‚Äôd definitely recommend Joe‚Äôs Diving Bali!!"
Joe's Diving Bali - Dive Castle - Tauchburg,Best Dive Experience With Logical Budget,10/01/2021,This is THE BEST DIVING EVER for me. Martin is superb and he is so patience that taking me and guiding me during our diving. And the price is the cheapest one but it is not lowering the qualities. For sure i never dive with the most beautiful experiences and the most competent dive master ever. Definitely i will come back. This wont be the last time dive with Joe's diving. Thanks to Mbak Frisca too Martin's wife. She helped me to prepare my dive too. Seriously if you wish to dive to Tulamben especially Liberty's wreck the dive site is crossing their resort and walking just 2 minutes. And the resort is the best too. Feelin homey there. See you for another dive :)
Joe's Diving Bali - Dive Castle - Tauchburg,Excellent quality for the price!,09/01/2021,"I went diving around Tulamben with my friend on this early September. While my friend was taking the open water dive certification, I accompanied him and went to stay on this place. Friska and Martin were also very nice! not to mention I really love their dogs Niki & Lucky. I love the place, the view, the castle-like architecture concept, and the pools! with the affordable price, I got all the necessary facilities like an air conditioner, hot water, breakfast, etc. The only thing that can be improved in my opinion I think that it would be better if they have a bidet/water gun near the closet. Coz we Asians definitely need bidets! lol. But the overall experience was excellent! 5 out 5!"
Joe's Diving Bali - Dive Castle - Tauchburg,Get my open water (OW) certification at this amazing place,08/01/2021,"It‚Äôs really such a superb and amazing experience with Martin & Ka Friska. They‚Äôre really really kind and helpful. I came here first to try Discover Scuba Diving and a year later I‚Äôm enjoying my time here during taking my SSI open water. Everything about this place makes me feel comfortable, the resort is very huge and beautiful plus the course is very fun! Highly recommend to everyone and will definitely come back again to Joe‚Äôs üëçüèª"
Joe's Diving Bali - Dive Castle - Tauchburg,This Looks Like A Something I Can't Afford and Had Amazing Dives,08/01/2021,"I contacted them in the last minute of my trip and got a very fast response. All ini all, the whole place is very unique and I really love the tower where you can see the Agung Volcano and around. My room was spacious, clean, comfortable, and everything ran well. The room also has many sockets so it really helps for those who bring camera and other electrical stuff. If I could suggest anything, it would be the toilet and front door lock. Even though it wasn't very big deal, I personally like to have a bidet on the closet. I also think that it would be better to have some lock key for the front door (they provide safe box though and during my stay I felt very safe). What's even better is that you will be accompanied by very good dogs, Lucky and Wiky. However, the highlight from‚Ä¶"

Aeera Villa,Cute homey space,10/01/2021,"the loft was really cute and homey. we really liked that the bed was upstairs and it was very comfy. And it was a really good size as well. We had really good sleep ins. However, the tv was a bit far distanced from the bed - if the tv was bigger it would've been better because it was quite far that it was hard to read subtitles. Some amenities was missing and we had to call and ask for some like - no tea, beach towels, sponge and washing fluid for dishwashing. The public pool and the sofa in the living room was quite dirty, sofa had marks on it so we had to cover with beach towels to sit to be on the safe side. Other than that, the staff was super friendly and warm which made the stay feel more at home."

We booked the Treehouse Bungalow and it was lovely bungalow with huge yard and spacious area. View of the hotel was amazing as we can see the unobstructed ocean view from the pool area. The hotel has direct and private access to the beach so it was great if you want to swim or surf at the beach. Breakfast was also good and it was served at the pool area so we can really enjoy the view. Check in process was also simple and easy. As we came a bit late, Sascha and Mick had arranged a security guard to assist us for checking in. They were a lovely and helpful couple, just amazed how they can managed the property from many years ago where nothing was built around the area. Will stay again and try honeymoon bungalow as they said it is the best seller‚Ä¶"

The Mulia,The Mulia,08/01/2021,"We always love our stay at The Mulia. One of the most memorable things for our family about the resort is the beach in front of The Mulia, the golden sand and calm sea water allows us to soak for hours while watching the waves which is in the middle of the sea. My son particularly love playing in the sand and look for sea shells, as the resort always managed to keep the beach rubbish free and very clean. Another thing we love is the pool in The Mulia which provide us such a luxurious privacy in one of their Cabanas. We literally can spend a whole day in the cabana, had our lunch, snacks and drinks delivered there, while lounging and swimming in the pool.

Prasana by Arjani Resorts,A beautiful property that had to endure the pandemic effect,10/01/2021,"Bali in general is affected badly by the pandemic, and that is visible at this hotel. I'll start with the pros. Pros: + Our sunrise villa was huge and the sunrise was very beautiful. + Helpful staff despite the difficult situation. + Very spacious bedroom, bathroom, and lounge area beside your very own private pool, also with outdoor bathtub that didn't lack privacy. + No buffet, but a la carte breakfast was good complete with fruit, juices, toast everyday. We also got floating breakfast. + We were on our honeymoon so we liked the quietness. Cons: - It's at the very end of small streets, a bit hidden from the main road and gets dark at night. I wouldn't want to ride motorcycle by myself at night. I don't recommend staying here if you go out a lot. - They cut back on‚Ä¶"

The Ritz-Carlton Bali,"Best WFB, Happy Belly Happy Life",08/01/2021,"Continual extended restrictions (PPKM) in Jkt made me think it was time to explore a WFB (Work from Bali) life. My best friend & I made a short visit at Ritz soon after we reached the airport. The front desk staff, Ms. Mega & later Ms. Mei, did a great job to persuade us, offering an upgrade to Ritz Suite for a special offer. We first bought a 4 night stay but then extending our stay for another 2 nights coz the kitchen team spoiled us with their great fb, service, warm smiles & jokes. The room itself, we love the smart toilet, room layout & extra space to maintain our sanity. Curtain is also the best, total blackout. The beach & garden are well maintained. The Chef Director, Mr. Raymond Siek, assisted by Chef Kojong, are the best duet ever to keep the kitchen busy with food‚Ä¶"

The Ritz-Carlton Bali, although it has somewhat slightly outdated (but still amazing!) hard products compared to the other brands in the Nusa Dua vicinity, it has so many - perhaps all of the staff are exemplary! They are the ones who made my stay memorable and delightful. The staff is impeccably groomed, well-spoken, attentive, and intuitive. Allow me to express my earnest thanks to Mario (Front Desk Agent), Isa Dewi (Front Desk Agent), Chef Made, and Ms. Desi (Beach Grill). Hard product-wise, the hotel vicinity, and the room are squeaky clean and well-maintained. The pool is always spotless. Food and beverages were delicious in‚Ä¶"

Maya Sanur Resort & Spa,A beautiful beachfront resort,10/01/2021,"We had a wonderful stay at Maya Sanur! Our room (Heavenly Ocean View Pool Suite) was really spacious and had a stylish, luxurious design. We absolutely loved the sunrise view over the ocean from our private pool. The food options at the resort are also great. We especially loved having lunch at the Tree Bar and we had an unforgettable romantic dinner at the Green Roof 360. You can also join different complimentary activities (like yoga) or just relax at one of the different pools. We also had a very relaxing treatment at their spa. All the staff at the resort was very friendly and welcoming during our whole stay. We would stay here again anytime!"
Maya Sanur Resort & Spa,Magnificent resort and best spa service,10/01/2021,"Maya Sanur Resort and spa located near sanur beach. It has access to Watu Jimbar beach. The concept is different with Maya Ubud. Meanwhile Maya Ubud already villas, Maya Sanur still use hotel room concept. .At the entrance, security check our body temperature and direct us to go to drop off. The drop off located at G floor and there are some staff who helping us to take our luggage and bring our luggage to lobby floor. Car parking located under the drop off and seems it still not busy so I got park at near lift. For lobby interior, I think its need to be renovated because seems spooky, and dark colour domination, but when you see the lagoon, the rooms, and the pool, its very beautiful. Maya Sanur have many photogenic photospots. Check in process needs approximately 15 minutes.‚Ä¶"
Maya Sanur Resort & Spa,Great ambience with great hospitality,10/01/2021,"I can proudly say that I have stayed in many, many hotels in Bali, but this hotel has the best hospitality. We only here for a short time, 3 days and 2 nights. So first day breakfast was ala carte, but the next day they turn it into buffet because I think there are increases of guests. My sister love the mie goreng so much (literally the best mie goreng we‚Äôve ever had), she was so sad that she can‚Äôt find it in the buffet. We asked the staff if we can order it off menu, and yes they made it for us! The smallest details like how the staff remember our names are very pleasant. Room was cozy, we had our lagoon so we can freely swim any time. And they have mountain bikes, so my father can use it to ride all over Sanur. If there‚Äôs anything I disliked, it was the ants on the breakfast‚Ä¶"

Our kids love their nasi goreng very much. They said their nasi goreng is the best. Bubur ayam is delicious as well. The ambience at the restaurant is beyond best. Yummy breakfast with beach view. So cozy and relaxing. The beach is really nice too. The sand is quite soft, the water is clear. No big wave, so the kids can play safely. We even found 5 starfishes there. We rent canoe there, bought kite and flew the kite at the beach. My‚Ä¶"

We keep bringing our friends here over and over again. There are wonderful day trips to nearby villages and beaches that are a cultural splendor! Highly recommended, by a family of high standards when it comes to traveling and service."
Ramayana Candidasa,"hugely let down, disappointed and pretty disgusted by a hotel we once loved",09/01/2021,"Having stayed twice previously at this hotel and also having had friends stay there on our recommendation, we had absolutely no hesitation in booking this hotel for our dream Bali wedding. We were booked to marry in September 2020 with 8 of our friends joining us. We were all booked on a 1 night non refundable deposit basis - except for 2 of the couples. So they knew where they stood financially, they paid the whole amount upfront. One of the couples also paid for a stay at the sister hotel in Kuta upfront. Then Covid struck. We postponed our wedding to May 2021 however as Covid continued to worsen, this meant that in Feb 2021 we then had to cancel our wedding completely. Bali is completely closed to tourism and also we could not leave the UK. This is where issues began.‚Ä¶"

When we (4 families)arrive at 3 pm, we have to wait more than 40 minutes for the room ready, but no one of the staff come to us to explain obout this, even the manager There is bellboy call Arya he is rough man, should be not working in a hospitality. He hand me my luggage to carry it to my room which is not ready yet. And asking me to ask with front desk with loud voice and not even smile. (Here i wonder ""where is the coordination between the staff "" The way he respond look like we stay for free. They should not make a different between local and foreigner tourist. This kind of experience you should not have in this ""5 star"" hotel."
Movenpick Resort & Spa Jimbaran Bali,An embarrassment for an Accor premium brand.,10/01/2021,"I asked if I could get a room with a nice view, and the team did very well on that part. The rest? Nightmare. 1) Resort credits I booked a promo package ALL - Rediscover Indonesia, which grants me a IDR 150K/day resort credits. It was included in special terms & condition. Don't bother, they will not honor it! I asked back and forth on the 1st and 2nd day and they keep asked me to wait and they'd reach me by a call to my room/cell, but nothing happen. On the 2nd day, I tried not to bother it as it would ruin my vacation, so I had massage and dinner somewhere else. However at 7-ish PM, the reception called to my room and finally confirmed that my reservation includes IDR 150K/night, so I'd get IDR 300K/stay. My heart breaks, because I already did massage and had dinner as well.‚Ä¶"

Movenpick Resort & Spa Jimbaran Bali,Disappointing Accor experience,08/01/2021,"Modern hotel with its own shopping complex however my experience at the hotel was a bit disappointing. This was the only Accor Hotel in Bali during my PPKM stay that failed to recognise Accor membership and did not give an upgrade despite hotel relatively empty. My other stays at Pullman, Novotel, Sofitel all did. Movenpick also did not have the promotion available as advertised on the Accor website. Jimbaran Beach access was also closed. During the day of my checkout, I got a call around 10:45 to remind me to checkout, which seemed to be rushing their guests. As a regular Accor guest probably will not return to this particular hotel."

Samaja Villas Kunti,"Dissapointed, very bad experience :(",10/01/2021,"When we first got in there were puddles in the living room area, so we had to call the guy to mop it. There were also YELLOW AND BROWN STAINS EVERYWHERE on the bed sheet, pillows, and towels (REALLY NASTY!!!!). The floor was oily the whole time, I'm not sure if they really cleaned it because there were black spot on the floor and the next day when we were asking them to clean our room it was still there. And the worst thing was the security. on our 2nd day, We were back at the hotel at night around 11pm, and our room weren't locked! The housekeeper forgot to locked our room as the keys were still hanging. OMG. The bathroom seems aged, the shower temperature also took forever to warm up, and there were stains in the bathup as well, and the bowel area smells like sewer sometimes.‚Ä¶"

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Nothing special,10/01/2021,"Sofitel bali used to be our fav hotel but we were dissapointed from our last stay. Service level was bad especially in restos and activities area, beach was boring with too much corals and rocks. We stayed 2 nights at prestige suite for wedding anniversary, and there were an event and we were surrounded by rooms of groups below and above our rooms. They made noisy sounds until late night and it was so disturbing! The pool was so cloudy, bfast was bland. Nothing special with the hotel."

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Nice.. but..,10/01/2021,"Pengalaman menginap kami 3H2N di sofitel kali ini cukup mengecewakan, mungkin karena di awal check in staff reception melihat outfit from top to toe dan terlihat sama saya, yes, saya menggunakan outfit seadanya pada waktu check in tapi saya rasa bukan hospitality seperti itu yang harus tamu dapat pada awal menginap and it‚Äôs not proper right? Receptionist merupakan wajah awal hospitality dari sebuah hotel.. please do smile and proper greetings seperti yang kalian biasa lakukan sebelum pandemi.. Dan untuk prokes pada waktu breakfast tolong lebi diperketat, krn kami masi lihat staff tidak mengingatkan tamu yg tidak menggunakan masker pd waktu breakfast..

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Worst Experiences,09/01/2021,Stayed here with my partner and hope to a relaxing time and be able to enjoy the room and all the facilities they offer. Everything is fine until we‚Äôre back from swimming at 6 noon and found not so small ant hanging around our table and floor. In a wet state after swimming we contacted the hotel staff and explain about everything. We didn‚Äôt bring food and haven‚Äôt ordered food but the ants keep coming and coming until there are so many. We waited almost half an hour and nothing. We contacted the operator again to req for room move and had to wait almost another half an hour for someone to come to our room and check the ants. My partner decided to go to the reception with the staff to ask for room move and had to wait almost an hour for someone to come to our room to help move‚Ä¶

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Below our expectation...,09/01/2021,"Upon our arrival, we were not getting a warm welcome. The front desk staff didn‚Äôt greet us with smile, the check in process was also longer than we expected. After finally checking in our room, we notice that there‚Äôs no body lotion in the bathroom. We called the guest service and they said it was provided by request, so we ordered one. After 2 hours, noone showed up to deliver it. We called again and wait. But we didn‚Äôt get it until we checked out. The slipper that is provided in room also too thin and poor quality. The breakfast was just okay, not a special one. We tried SoSpa, it was great and meet our expectation. Overall, we were not really happy with our stay and with 190 usd per night, there are many hotels in Bali which can offer better facilities and service (even‚Ä¶"

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Good stay! Would totally recommend!,09/01/2021,"We stayed 3 nights in Sept 2021. Everything was great. Check-in was punctual. The check-in time is 3PM. We arrived at 2.30 and got our room at 3PM (absolutely no delay like many reviewers said). Every staff we met was very nice and accommodating. The room was clean and tidy. We found no issue with our room except for the broken sprinkle in the toilet. We asked for it to be fixed but no one came. We were only a bit bothered by it and too lazy to follow up so we just let it be. The AC was sooo cold - we love it. Hate staying in a hotel with AC that‚Äôs not functioning well and the AC in Sofitels worked really well (love it!). The staffs at breakfast was so nice. The foods were great. So many varieties!

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Pertama kali menginap dan tidak akan kembali,08/01/2021,"Kami memesan kamar untuk dua malam termasuk sarapan pagi. Pros: - Staf yang berada di depan lobby ramah dan sangat membantu. Terima kasih kepada Artana, Yoda dan Angga. - Staf wanita yang menyajikan minuman juga ramah. - Kamar nyaman dan cukup besar. Kami mendapatkan 'sedikit' pemandangan laut dari balkon. Saya katakan sedikit karena pemandangan laut nya tertutup oleh bangunan di antara kamar hotel dan pantai. - Pantai bersih dan indah. Cons: - Air dari shower selalu membasahi lantai di depan pintu shower yang mengakibatkan lantai licin. - Siang hari elevator hanya satu yang difungsikan. Malam hari seluruh elevator tidak berfungsi.

Sofitel Bali Nusa Dua Beach Resort,Loving the beach and free bicycling rental,08/01/2021,"We were pleased to be upgraded to the 1 bedroom pool villa. Was spacious and really good air conditioning as in the afternoon, the villa is superbly hot,l. The villas are mostly glass door with glaring sun shine into the villa giving green house effect. So the ac units placed are perfect for cooling system! However, structurally the villa we stayed in had no privacy at all. The higher building rooms across our villa could look into our bathroom and outdoor shower. Though that entire building was closed (only partial rooms and villas are operating), something needs to be done for future full operation of the hotel Some part of the garden inside the villa near the bathroom window, needs lots of tender loving care We aren‚Äôt sure if the vast majority of the staffs were trainees‚Ä¶"

Originally booked for 2 nights. Then came the travel restrictions. Asked the hotel for reschedule arrangement pending the government update on the restrictions. Strike 1: asked by the hotel to provide the replacement booking date within 24 hours from my request. I came back saying if they have government planning on the restriction or if they know how COVID will progress, then let me know so I can make the decision. They later gave me 5 days to think about which was appreciated. Then after 5 days, the situation still not improving as much to have less restriction. I asked for‚Ä¶"

My latest stay was at 1-3th Oct 2021 at their suite, the lowest room category in the resort. But, the room itself meets my expectations. It was quite big with mini pantry, dining room and also living room in it. The resort has it's dedicated beach area called Karma Beach. You have to go down by their private elevator. It's kind of unique experience as you were given the lushly view of the ocean during going down to the beach where also happened to be breakfast area. You can also enjoy complimentary water sports with lifeguard to assist you. The cream on top is their infinity pool.

The Astari - Villa and Residence,Menginap di Astari adalah pengalaman yang tak terlupakan.,03/01/2014,Ini adalah pertama kalinya saya menginap di sebuah vila di Bali. Saya kagum karena kamarnya begitu terawat dengan baik dan membuat saya terkesan dan menikmati sebagian besar tempat tidur yang sangat nyaman! Sangat menyenangkan menginap di vila ini. Kamar mandi luar ruangan?? Mengagumkan...Saya merasa seperti tinggal di alam terbuka. Layanannya bagus dan stafnya ramah dan mau membantu. Kolam renangnya sedikit kecil di vila tapi kolam renang utamanya jauh lebih besar dan bagus untuk bersantai. Bersiaplah saat hujan karena vila memiliki kamar mandi luar ruangan (sedikit basah =D). Makanannya enak dan Anda HARUS mencoba sosisnya.
The Astari - Villa and Residence,Layanan bagus dan kamar bersih.,03/01/2014,"Kamar hotelnya sangat bersih dan nyaman. Stafnya selalu bersedia membantu dan sarapannya dibawakan ke kamar Anda dengan sentuhan yang cantik. Kolam renangnya hanya beberapa kaki dari kamar Anda, dan ini menyenangkan! Saya menyampaikan keluhan yang sama seperti orang sebelumnya tentang musik di sekitar kolam renang. Namun, pilihan musik yang buruk dan volumenya hanya berlangsung satu pagi saat saya berada di sana. Selebihnya saya merasakan pengalaman yang sangat tenang dan menenangkan di tepi kolam. Saya juga yakin jika Anda meminta petugas di meja depan untuk mematikan atau mengecilkan musiknya, mereka akan bersedia melakukannya karena mereka selalu ingin membuat masa menginap Anda menyenangkan. Cukup berjalan kaki sebentar dari pantai Jimbaran dan kebanyakan restoran ke hotel‚Ä¶"
The Astari - Villa and Residence,Astari hotel yang nyaman dengan harga terjangkau,03/01/2014,"Kesan pertama saat kami berdua menginap di Astari sungguh luar biasa, melampaui harapan kami. Astari menyediakan atmosfir yang nyaman untuk bersantai, jauh dari keramaian. Kami menikmati liburan kami untuk menikmati ulang tahun pernikahan kami di Bali. Kolam renangnya umumnya besar dan kami dapat menggunakannya setiap saat. Astari memiliki 14 kamar yang dibagi menjadi 2 lantai. Kebetulan kamar kami di lantai pertama, istri saya benar-benar menyukai kamar kami karena langsung menghadap ke kolam renang. Udara sekitar di Astari jauh dari polusi dan kemacetan (Kuta penuh dengan kemacetan di mana pun). kami mendapatkan sarapan di pagi hari sesuai dengan apa yang kami inginkan. Saat memesan makanan untuk makan siang kami, kami makan dalam kamar. Astari menyediakan makanan yang‚Ä¶"
The Astari - Villa and Residence,Tempat untuk bersantai dan menyegarkan pikiran anda,03/01/2014,"Ukuran kamarnya lebih besar daripada sebagian besar hotel baru di Bali. Sangat terjangkau dari segi harga untuk ukuran kamar demikian. Udaranya sangat segar di pagi dan malam hari. Jauh dari keramaian dan atmosfernya sangat santai dan damai. Cara yang baik untuk menghabiskan waktu menyegarkan pikiran. Tempatnya 15 menit jalan kaki untuk ke pantai. Tetapi, mereka juga menyediakan transportasi gratis untuk mengantar anda. Transportasi gratis dengan perjanjian untuk ke Kuta dan Nusa Dua. Karyawannya ramah dan melayani. Sangat membantu dalam memberikan informasi atau mencarikan taksi. Hal terbaik yang harus dinikmati adalah kamar tidur dan kolam renangnya. Sangat berprivasi!! Terima kasih Astari"

Ambience and service was also brilliant - staff go out of their way to help. The only minor annoyance is that the fitness center is in the Hyatt next door and with pre-booking required and limited capacity, its a hassle. Still, I prefer the Andaz over the Hyatt Regency next door."

Staff was very attentive, they were quick on their service, everything was catered for with smile on their face. The kids club here is amazing! They have everything and Ms Putu was very kind. I only hoped that they have more information on thekr website as it is difficult to check what facilities they have, what is included with the room etc. I was surprised that my room did not inclide breakfast as during booking it was not specified. However we ended up purchasing breakfast on top and it was superb! Breakfast staff was very attentive as well. Basically everything exceeded our expectation. I was most impressed with our suite, we stayed in the‚Ä¶"
Andaz Bali,Newest Attraction in Sanur,08/01/2021,"This was my my second visit to this amazing property. First one was a month ago I went to Andaz to check this new hotel. I went to the deli for some wine and was served by someone named Heri he was very courteous and not long after a chef came by to greet us and explained a bit about their products (sorry I forgot your name :(). For the second visit I came by to try their Breakfast and was greeted by Jesisca, she elaborately explained the menu and recommended some dishes which now I‚Äôm craving for! Our table later on is taken care by Mona which i think she is the jewel of Wok Wok. She could carry a genuine pleasant conversation and she came by to our table from time to time to make sure that our needs are fulfilled. During my breakfast I also met Heri and surprisingly he‚Ä¶"
Andaz Bali,"Second visit., still very happy",08/01/2021,"Visit Wok Wok for breakfast and was very happy with the spread. Very satisfying and I throughly enjoy the time I was there. Chic restaurant, not overcrowded, and very welcoming. The staff are very accommodating and nothing was ever too much. Thank you Adit, Utami, Yani, Diah, Andre, Agung and bartender Krisna adi, you guys are awesome Happy with the coffee and fresh juices that was available. The front of the house I met was awesome too, although I am not coming to stay but they are very friendly. Shout out to Sudi, Michelle, Ayu Ria and Sarly I‚Äôve visit Fisherman once and it doesnt dissapoint, Wok Wok is satisfying. Looking forward to visit again soon .. keep up the good work"
Andaz Bali,Great place to chill,08/01/2021,"Today, i visited a recently built resort called Andaz Hotel in Sanur. The moment you are in the hotel you are greeted by a really nice lobby, a lot of green and a lot of wood with simple cut outs, the overall architecture of Andaz is really nice, also makes a good spot for taking photos. Also big thanks to one of the staff there named Ms. Yunik for showing me the around the place and the other very friendly staff. Moving on the food was great most notably the interesting chefs greeting, it was a black rice cracker with sauce that consist of mayo, yuzu and spices. Even with my short stay at that place and bad timing (raining) i enjoyed every bit of it, overall rate that place a 5/5 would go there again."
Andaz Bali,Amazing service!,08/01/2021,"I came here with my family for breakfast at Wok Wok and the wait staffs warmly welcomed us and were incredibly respectful. Mona was very knowledgeable with the menu and gave us great recommendations for breakfast. We had a fun time trying out varieties of food through Mona. Heri came and refilled our drinks and made sure everything was taken care of and made sure our orders came through. Jesisca also came and explained to us the different meals in the menu and started us off with our breakfast. All of them were extremely kind! Great food and hospitality from all of them, and my family and I will come back here for sure!"

Pullman Bali Legian Beach,Need maintenance but excellent services!,10/01/2021,"Yes it is an old hotel and it has some wear/tear. However, when staying at a hotel, services are one of the most important aspect and Pullman Legian managed to deliver the excellent services despite the difficult situation. 1) Reception and check-in I was in a really bad mood when I came due to my bad experiences at the previous place where I was staying in Jimbaran. However, the warm welcome from Ms. Eni and her team managed to fix my mood. I also did not expect the premium suite upgrade which I truly appreciate. 2) Room I stayed in room 3402 which is a bit far from the elevator. This premium suite is nice with a great garden view from different directions and the separated living space also useful for me when I'm doing my remote work.

Pullman Bali Legian Beach,Happy ! Good value for money,10/01/2021,"Stayed 5 nights With the price of Average rp700k per night incl breakfast we are very happy especially with the very good breakfast here. We were upgraded to grand deluxe room, but the room although spacious with nice balcony and large bathroom and closets but old with very small TV with rather blurry pictures, not up to the 5star hotel standard, floor was dusty upon our check in so need to wear room slipper. Room sound proof also not really good. But well considering the price, breakfast, location, hospitality , easy parking, and beautiful gardens for us the stay was still good value."
Pullman Bali Legian Beach,Short but fabulous stay,09/01/2021,"After a bad experience at another hotel we decided to spend our last night at the Pullman. We checked in early but as the room wasn't quite ready we sat by the pool enjoying a relaxing coffee. On going to our room we had been upgraded to a suite which made my day after the previous night and a big thank you to Arya, Hari & Dodi for arranging this. The suite was spacious and tastefully furnished and meticulously clean. Dinner was at the Deli restaurant where you can sit inside or if you prefer outside by the gardens and pool. Although the menu is limited it has a selection of local and western foods so something for everyone and our meal was thoroughly enjoyed. Breakfast was again at the Deli restaurant which is an inverted buffet (you choose and they serve it) and again a‚Ä¶"
Pullman Bali Legian Beach,"Steal our Money, Poor, feeble, and Shoddy",10/01/2021,"We initially plan to stay 4 nights into this 5 stars mediocore hotel. Slow check in process, and we got free upgrade room. But, with the vile and feeble room. We moved to Suite room, which is claimed as their super fantastic room. We agree to add the charge and move to their Suite. But, the aircon was leak and you got mosquito bites as bonus during your sleep. We choose to move to another hotel in the second day. They agree to refund all our money, and promise to charge one night only! And voila, they charge more without our authorisation. The reception also have terrible attitude, giving us checkout bill without envelope and no explanation about extra charge. We ask the details and she said that's HER MANAGER fault! OMG!!!!! Is it really 5 star hotel? Is it Pullman Standart? ‚Ä¶"

Pullman Bali Legian Beach,Big hotel at end of pantai kuta street,09/01/2021,"A local tourist at pandemic situation, for a ocupancies is less for big building like pullman, atmosphere is silent, rooftop poll still in good condition, simple Breakfast with health protocol applied, room is good, deep sleep, rain shower, car park, best value for money"

Pullman Bali Legian Beach,Great Experience,09/01/2021,"The first experience to travel to bali during Pandemic and turns out it was the perfect choice! the staff at the reception make sure the guest meets the health protocol and standard before checking us in. They also explain the brekfast situation and special offers (which was great for an Accor member). They only open one tower since there are major renovation going on on the other two towers (can't wait!). Although some of special kits they used to have on the room are nowhere to be found (such as umbrella and beach bag), the room situation is still as great as the first time they open the Hotel back then. Definitely will come back again and again. props for the management!"
The Yubi Boutique Villas,Good location,10/01/2021,The hotel strategically located in Petitenget near nice restaurants and only 5 minutes walk from the beach.

Nirjhara,A waterfall dream,10/01/2021,"Nirjhara is your waterfall dream come true, from the moment you step into this property until the end is nothing short of breathtaking. This is not your average 5 star establishment. The staff will make sure you have a memorable stay througout. Shoutout to Mas Dewa, Duta, Gede, Kupit and Bu Liliek you guys are what makes the Nirjhara exceptional. The level of personalization is something else and believe me i have stayed in many high end properties, this one is right up there."
Nirjhara,Therapeutic stay with waterfall and luscious jungle surrounding,10/01/2021,"The perfect place for those who are seeking serenity and time to spend in the hotel. The establishment is beyond beautiful. So far, they are the only one who let the guess choose the scent of the amenities. Swimming Pool is actually the best, with controlled temperature, overlooking the famous waterfall, and low level of Calcium hypochlorite. Gym is 24/7 which again, first time having this. They also have private cinema that you can also book :) nice touch. However, most of the in house activities happened on Weekend, so during our stay, there wasnt much going on. Few stuff that this hotel could improve: the quality of the toilet - the bidet was quite painful. Also, a bit disappointed with their 1-ply toilet tissue and the maintenance of the balcony. We stayed at 1 Br river‚Ä¶"
Nirjhara,A room with waterfall view and private cinema!!,08/01/2021,"It's a common thing if a hotel provides ocean or pool view, but how about waterfall view? Welcome to Nirjhara! Nirjhara itself means waterfall in Sanskrit. The main pool, restaurant, and some rooms overlook the waterfall. I suggest you to stay at Canopy Suite number 37 where you can have waterfall view next to your bed. The Canopy suite consists of 2 level. The private roof deck at the second level is very huge with bathtub. You can see sunset from there. The price of the FnB is also affordable. Another cream on top is their private mini cinema with many film selections."

Needed to cut short my last holiday on July due to new PPKM rules, and without any hassle, Padma granted me the night I didnt use (but need to be under the same price bucket). Back on September to use it. Lovely. The front staffs - the team is different - but stayed as professional and friendly, I undertstood they are intern (?)

Origin Uluwatu,Unwind in this tranquil surround.,09/01/2021,"The ease of booking was continued on arrival, with assistance of luggage taken to the well prepared and appointed tent. The garden setting made it easy to unwind and feel far removed from the daily grind of living in paradise. Inside our pool tent, the kitchen area relies on the use of room service or the open space seating of the restaurant and pool. The fridge purely for drinks. There was cold and hot water in apply supply for a Kintamani Bali coffee in a bag or a lovely hot cup of Twinnings Tea.

The hotel itself is clean and quiet, with all of the amenities of a high-end hotel. The tents were comfortable with air-con, hot water and a smart tv. The beds are amazing. Each tent has it's own little dining space which was great, you feel like you have a little living room with a dining table to relax and eat meals. The bathroom is all outside, but covered so you get that amazing breeze while you brush your teeth or take a bath. They have the sweetest lounge area around the large communal pool with a fire pit. We spent several evenings out there just reading our books or watching the stars. The area around Origin isn't built up so it's very quiet and feels like you really are camping. But, the‚Ä¶"
Echoland,Not privacy,09/01/2021,"The rooms looks nice and clean, but what I didn't like about Echoland are the windows in the room. It doesn't give you privacy because the curtain is not good.

Potato Head Studios,Trailblazing,10/01/2021,"Great to see this amazing space back open. From the superlative service (not uncommon in Bali but extra attentive here...), idyllic setting, creative design and thoughtful touches throughout, this place is an experience. You just get a good feeling from entering this space and as you move throughout it. There are other places with a similar view, but these guys know how to frame it and add the soundtrack‚Ä¶ The main pool area offers one of the best vantage points for sunset in the area. The Sunset Park deck is hard to beat for sundowners. The breakfast is one of the best I‚Äôve had in the area. Even the drink selection is top notch. The ocean view puts it over the top. The rooms have thoughtful touches throughout, from the wooden cutlery and bamboo straws to use during your trip‚Ä¶"

We loved everything about it; from the moment we checked in we felt like part of the family. All the staff knew our names and provided a very personal, friendly but professional customer service. The facilities were fantastic; we loved exploring the library, the gym was very impressive and the room was chic and comfortable. We spent most of our 2 days by the pool, the waiting staff were attentive without being pushy and the selection on the pool food menu was amazing and surprisingly affordable. The cocktails were expertly made and the servers menu knowledge meant they knew exactly what to recommend to pair with the delicious oysters we ordered for sunset.

Potato Head Studios,Superb,09/01/2021,"One of the most amazing stays ever !! The studios are spacious and have everything to make you feel home from home with a view to die for and complemented by an extraordinary array of people that make you feel as if you have always lived there ! The restaurant Kaum serves food that you will never forget and breakfast by the pool looking at the waves of the ocean will make you dream of those moments for years! I'm quite demanding when it comes to service - but I could not fault anything - just as the title of this review says ""SUPERB"""
Potato Head Studios,Mrs. Upi,09/01/2021,"Welcome new concept hotel in Seminyak Bali, Potato Head Studio, everything touch is amazing, all staf very fiendly and very good service, thank you All team.....hope we can stay again next time, very recommended....."
Potato Head Studios,All about the good vibes...,08/01/2021,"By saying i only 'enjoyed my 2 night stay' would be an understatement. We had an ocean facing view and normally that alone elevates the room. However, for this instance the room matched the view. Hand in hand they worked with each other perfectly. Staying at a place is meant to take you away, its meant to stimulate the imagination as much as it stimulates relaxation. It did both for me. The space is wide and breezy, the staff are genuinely warm and authentic, nothing seemed like a hassle and everything seemed like a pleasure. The creativity, the design the little thoughtful touches is what separates itself from others. Its a total experience and i will be back."
Potato Head Studios,Beach front get away,08/01/2021,We had an amazing weekend stay with our 2 children. Check in we were given water bottles for us and our children which is an amazing touch . The rooms facing the ocean is so beatiful and warm adults loved the table that becomes a bar And the kids said it was the best bath they ever had . The breakfast is amaZing with right balance or western local cuisine. Chairs very uncomfortable for both adults kids. Which is a shame ! Pool had amazing kids section and kids activity was organized one day with arts and crafts . We had a great stay and would recommend with kids .
Potato Head Studios,All the little details,08/01/2021,"I think this is the nicest hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in - there is so much attention to detail in every (seemingly) little detail of the property, the room and the entire experience. I need to come back again to take it all in... we stayed in an ocean front room which was perfect for a couple, or with kids - very spacious and impeccable with loads of amenities and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. We are coming back for sure. Thank you"
Potato Head Studios,Favourite resort,08/01/2021,"I can‚Äôt speak highly enough of our stay at potatohead. From the moment we arrived we felt like we stepped into another world of relaxation and bliss. The team are so well trained, attentive and polite, I‚Äôve never experienced such fantastic customer service. The room are gorgeous with every detail thought of to make our stay comfortable, from the mini bar to the extremely comfortable bed. Not to mention that everything is sustainable, they really nailed everything. The kids were kept busy, with yoga and art classes, they also got to experience a turtle release, something that I know they will remember for ever. Now to the delicious food! OMG we are big foodies in our family and the food was so epic ! Every dish we tried we were wowed by. Potatohead is famous for its cocktails‚Ä¶"
Potato Head Studios,Feels like home,08/01/2021,"Stayed for 2 nights in the desa studio. What i love most about my stay was the excellent service and the fact that they greet you with ""welcome home"". It does really feel like a home away from home. Everything about the stay was personal. The ocean front sea breeze wherever you go. The interior inside the room is very comforting and super inspired how they turn waste into beautifully designed items that are super functional at the same time. A must try is the KAUM menu at tanaman restaurant. Indonesian comfort food at its finest. Starting off the day with a morning meditation on the rooftop, followed by laps in the 50 m pool, breakfast, working in the libary, a gym workout, topping it off with one of the best massages I have ever had. This place has it all. Can't wait to‚Ä¶"

Potato Head Studios,The Perfect Holiday,08/01/2021,"The rooms were exceptional. The beds are so comfortable! The overall design and layout makes for a very comfortable stay.

One of the best holidays in a long time."
Potato Head Studios,Perfect Staycation,08/01/2021,"Thank you, Potato Head Studios for the best weekend I've had in a long time!

Outstanding value. Stay here!"

The rooms are very clean and well-maintained, the staff very attentive and friendly. The place is quiet and the beds very comfortable. All tap water is salt water so travellers might need to get used to this. For us, it was no problem at all. We were travelling in a group and Wayan, the owner, let us access the kitchen and use all facilities like we belong to his family. We were very happy with our stay and will definitely come back again!"
Nusa Veranda Sunset Villas & restaurant,A nice sunset spot,09/01/2021,"The place is really amazing. The view on the open ocean (sunset), nusa Lembongan and the seaweed farms make it very special.

La Joya Biu Biu Resort,Slow response on event inquiry,08/01/2021,"I had such an enthusiasm to create a wedding event. But it took them long time to response and ask for a proper quotation of a wedding for the next six month. I understand that everyone is overwhelmed with the pandemic and the downsliding of tourism industry. I was just wondering, how can we all move on and continue with good and clear purpose in doing business. The quotated price was unclear (as they increased the number to 30% without any explanations on the cost). I asked them to give us the quotation in breakdown details and no reply what so ever. All we need is transparency and check list so we know what has been included and not within the proposal. I waited for four days and no answer from the manager.

Sini Vie Villa,A great honeymoon villa with pool and amazing interior,09/01/2021,"The room is very clean, when we first entered the villa room, its clean, cold AC breeze, music is already playing, amenities and honeymoon flowers prepared, the jacuzzi is prepared too. The interior is amazing, looks very good, especially the bathroom garden. Personally I love it. However the location of Sini Vie's Villa is kind of hard to find, as we need to go ""deeper"" into the complex area. But at the same time the location is kind of ""hidden"" so it's far away from crowdness . May I suggest put bigger billboard/direction signage, if possible. We purchased the honeymoon package, and there were some miscommunication from the sale that we were promised wine BEFORE payment, and D-1 AFTER payment, we were told the WINE were changed into ICED WATER. To be honest that's very‚Ä¶"

Suasana villa sangat nyaman,tenang,cocok buat santai. Saat pagi hati saya minta bantuan untuk memprint tiket pesawat saya,krn ada masalah pd maskapainya daan ternyata dibantu dengan sangat tulus oleh Mas Yudi saat itu. Dan Mas Yudi jg komunikatif dn informatif bangeett. Pasti bakal nginep di Sampatti Villas lgi sih kalo ke bali. Minusnya cuma ga ada Plang or Neon Box di gang masuk yg pencahayaanya kurang.

Thank you so much for the decoration in the room and the floating breakfast, really appreciated it. I have one feedback that I forgot to mention during c/o.

Amatara Agung Raka,Hidden Gem in the Heart of Ubud,09/01/2021,Me and my partner stayed at this resort one night and we were amazed by the beauty inside this resort. The Balinese atmosphere is very thick and calming even though we are in the middle of the city. This resort made us feel as if we were away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Too bad we only booked for one night because we had a reservation at another hotel. We will come back when visiting Bali next year.
Amatara Agung Raka,Ubud Staycation!,08/01/2021,"Stayed 1 night at their 1 bedroom pool villa. The villa was spacious with open living room & kitchen.

The staff are all very attentive and kind. The location is superb! Close to a lot of cafes and Monkey Forest."
New Pondok Sara Villa,Rundown very disappointing,10/01/2021,I booked the two bedroom villa for four days and had to leave after two nights walking away as there is a no refund policy. The photos shown are many years old the villas are very run down and the breakfast is terrible only nasi goreng or noodles. Only two of the villas are open as the rest are abandoned with weeds and rubbish. Needs full renovation I paid $100 a night and it was way too much.

This time the manager came, made a courtesy and told us since it‚Äôs late at night we could leave our belongings at the previous room (122) have the key, and sleep at the new room (121). We had a good night sleep, the pillows and 200x200 bed were great. The next day during breakfast the manager approached us,‚Ä¶"

J Hotel Kuta,:)))),08/01/2021,"First of all, the most special thing about this hotel is its interior design, very classy. many photo spots in the lobby area that can be selected for use. Cons? Hm, almost all. - What is advertised by the hotel in their social media or website with the reality is totally different in regard of COVID 19 health protocols implementations. (at check-in, no one checked our body temperature, offered to use hand sanitizer). By this case, if we have a fever and it turns out one of us positive for covid 19 but we passed the check in process easily. could you still ensure the safety of all guests staying with you? we just wondering, do all point on CHSE implemented by the hotel's staff in daily basis? - Very poor room conditions. quite a lot of wall stains, the duvet cover has lots of‚Ä¶"

Walau mereka sedang dalam proses renovasi tetapi tidak terdengar bunyi nya dari jalan atau dari jalan depan villa sampai di hari kami check out. Kamarnya bersih dan rapi dan stafnya sangat menolong ketika anda bertanya untuk meminta bantuan meski mereka tak terlihat di mana-mana, mungkin mereka ingin memberi anda privasi.

Bugan Villas,Mengecewakan dan di luar harapan kami,11/01/2016,"Kami sampai di villa pada pukul 9 malam dan coba tebak, kami disambut oleh sebuah villa yang terlihat sangat kotor. Lantainya berdebu, sama juga dengan toiletnya. Sepertinya tak ada yang menginap di sana selama bertahujn-tahun. Yang terburuk adalah kolam renangnya. Air di kolam renangnya terlihat sangat kotor dan mungkin menjadi tempat yang bagus untuk membiakkan nyamuk berton-ton, karena terlihat nyamuk beterbangan di kamar kammi. Sarapannya disediakan di dua hari selama kami di sana, dengan porsi sedikit. Dua buah roti kecil, satu telur dan hot dog (hot dog yang bukan berukuran biasa tapi sepotong hot dogyang menyedihkan). Saya sangat kecewa dan terlihat sangat berbeda dengan yang dilihat di fotonya. Ini adalah terakhir kali kami di sini. Semoga sukses kepada siapa saja‚Ä¶"

Morabito Art Cliff,Most Unique and Amazign Place I've Ever Stayed!,08/01/2021,"I can't say enough amazing things about Morabito Art Cliff! It's been a dream to stay here for so long, and I'm almost in tears writing this because it's been a dream come true now! We have now stayed here 2 times, and plan on coming back again and again. Hands down the most unique place I've ever stayed. Nestled on the cliff of Bingin Beach in Uluwatu, this place has the best views I've ever seen, the rooms are all so unique and filled with character. The staff is super helpful and really friendly. I will never forget the moments we created here, and I guarantee that anyone that is considering staying here will create priceless and timeless memories as well."
MAMAKA by Ovolo,An amazing stay at Mamaka Bali,10/01/2021,"The hotel located in front of Kuta Beach and near Beachwalk mall. I stayed at top gun suite room for two nights. Everything was amazing! The room very clean, the facilities so complete (Apple TV, Marshall speaker, etc), they even give us compliment mini bar, all the staff sooo friendly and hotel facilities very good. They even have some washing machine and the guest can use that for free. They also have a very beautiful rooftop bar! You can see a very beautiful Kuta Beach from the rooftop. See you again Mamaka, I will definitely back again ‚ù§Ô∏è"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,Warm and helpfull Staff,10/01/2021,"Pengalaman yang menyenangkan saat kami menginap di Mamaka selama 6 hari..Hotelnya bersih, ruang kamarnya unik dan ada teras outdoor, dilengkapi dengan wifi internet yang baik dan smart TV, Kolam Renang di bagian atap gedung dengan pemandangan ke pesisir pantai yang hebat, sarapannya dengan porsi yang cukup, lokasi hotel tepat di depan pantai, dan yang utama Staff-nya (Jadna) sangat perhatian dan membantu keperluan saya selama menginap di hotel.. Puas dan berkesan..!!"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,My fun-taztic stay!,10/01/2021,"The property is amazing, setting of the room is great, wonderful king size bed and comfy pillows! Gitta the manager is an example of excellence! She provided genuine care while assisting me from from pre-arrival and ensure everything was perfect during my stay. Well done! Melinda the Director was fantastic! She was very friendly and helpful. She is running a very tight ship and providing an experience worth coming back for. Kudos to her! Last but not least, Jaena the front desk was so courteous and fast enough to do my check in process! Awesome!"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,Perfection at it‚Äôs best,10/01/2021,"As an avid traveller I have stayed in many hotels over the years‚Ä¶ and I am not one to make a review unless the expectation goes way beyond. Mamaka by Ovolo is by far the best property I have stayed at. It‚Äôs not just the attention to detail the hotel provides but the staff are absolutely outstanding. Upon leaving my room, I noticed the General Manager (Joel) actually working with the housekeeping staff, cleaning rooms. Definitely the most hands on GM I‚Äôve noticed. Obviously this leadership resonates with the staff resulting in a hotel that is second to none. Highly recommend!"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,"Suuper friendly, nice room, clean room, nice facilities, nice location, SUPER DOG FRIENDLY!",09/01/2021,"We were super shocked to have discovered this nice of a hotel this late! I can only assume this hotel would be super crowded once the pandemic is over just because they are super well-maintained. Plus, it is right in front of kuta beach and it is DOG FRIENDLY!!! They treated Chero nicely and all the staffs love chero. I cant lie, i love it when a dog friendly property treats my dog with love, because when you are a dog-friendly property, YOU ARE meant to be friendly to my dog. Just like how mamaka did! Definetely recommended and will come back! Love, Cheroüíì"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,MY NEW BALI GO-TO HOTEL + HANG OUT!,08/01/2021,"From the moment I stepped into Mamaka, Bali, I was welcomed with good vibes from each of the staff! Such an awesome first impression, which continued throughout my entire long stay. Nothing was too much trouble! As a health + freedom entrepreneur I‚Äôve stayed in a multitude of hotels across the globe and this by far has the funkiest fit out, and the most modern equipped hotel gym I‚Äôve ever trained in! I can‚Äôt rave about this enough as it‚Äôs always the first thing I look at when selecting a hotel! Mamaka‚Äôs beachfront location is awesome for all levels of surfing or just for a swim, and the rooftop sunsets are spectacular, as are the cocktails and huge swimming pool! Little touches like free washing machines, towels in the gym, all toiletries and hand sanitiser everywhere‚Ä¶"
MAMAKA by Ovolo,Spectacular hotel with stunning views,08/01/2021,"I have been staying at Mamaka for the last 3 weeks and couldn't be happier! My Swagger suite is spacious for long stays, with everything that I need, with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. The rooms are decorated in a fresh beach chic feel, most with ocean views. This hotel is right opposite Kuta beach with easy access for surfing and swimming. The staff are amazing and can't do enough for you, and cater for all needs. The gym is so well equipped and kept spotless. There are plenty of lounge beds by the rooftop pool so no one misses out, and gets sunshine all day with a lovely breeze and spectacular views of Kuta and the coastline. I can't recommend this hotel enough....truly amazing!!!"

Anari Villas Kuta,Honeymoon stay with husband,10/01/2021,"Stay 6 malam di Anari Villas Kuta, lokasi strategis, dekat dengan pusat kota, suasana hening ga terdengar suara2 jalan raya jadi cocok bgt untuk yang mau beristirahat stelah full sharian muter2 bali, staff ramah semua dan fast respon.. kebersihn cukup baik walaupun msh ada yang miss disudut2 ruangan, but its okay so far.. drainase kamar mandi sepertinya salah penempatan, karena air menggenang tidak mengarah ke tempat drainase.. kolam renang nya private kereenn cukup luas dan terawat, parkiran mobil juga tersedia pas bgt untuk yang mau road trip ke bali.. bs sewa berbagai bentuk floaties dan tersedia jasa laundry shari jadiiiii üôè thank u Anari Villa Kuta"

Raffles Bali,Five stars,09/01/2021,"This is truly the best hotel in Bali I have been to. The first thing that impresses is the beautiful nature in which the hotel fits so harmoniously. This is a truly exclusive place for Bukit. And of course the service, it was just great. I definitely recommend visiting this hotel."
Villa Victoria Nusa Penida,READ FIRST BEFORE BOOKING!!,10/01/2021,"Read before booking anywhere!!! The photos of Villa Victoria do not do this place justice...it far exceeds all expectations (despite having all the 5-star reviews and setting the expectations high) and is the nicest place we have stayed in Indonesia. From the top quality bedding that offered the best night sleep (best mattress and pillows, so comfortable!), to the sealed bedrooms so you never have mosquito problems, deep copper bath, large bathrooms with double vanity, beautiful towels and linen, the decor design was stunning and everywhere has panoramic views over the ocean (with Bali and the mountains in the background!) Every tiny detail has been considered in this villa. It should be referred to as a 5-star retreat space! The owners are a Brazilian and Russian couple and‚Ä¶"
Autentik Nusa Penida,Incredible experience,08/01/2021,Stayed here for one night with friends and had an amazing time! Definitely would have booked for longer if we‚Äôd known how incredible it was in advance :) beautiful location and easy to find - something that can‚Äôt be said for everywhere on Penida. Staff were lovely and helpful and arranged everything we needed - even let us have late checkout. Free breakfast was delicious. Would 100% stay again

"SOTIS Villa Canggu, Bali",Unhappy,08/01/2021,Villa was pretty damaged and I came back to look at it 3 times to make sure it was getting fix and manager was confirmed with us that the place would be ready for us on the day and on moving day he decided not to stick to his deal and instead just give it off to someone else without letting us have a chance of saying much and any kind of notifications. Just said good luck.. so basically wasted me and my friends time going down to check the place 3 times‚Ä¶ Pretty bad management to be honest.
Telaga Beach View,Cukup sekali dan pengalaman kurang bagus!!! Ada apa di room 3 ?ü§£ü§£,09/01/2021,"Melalkukan pembayaran jangan sampai terkecoh dinmintai ktp pada saat cek out , seharusnya di mintai ktp saat cek in ,Kamar nya sangat kotor kamar mandi bau dan pipa shower bocor ,atap bocor .

JAPA Suites & Villas,"Japa Ubud, 2 thumbs",10/01/2021,"Even though the whole area of this hotel is not very big, but every rooms are special especially the villas. As a new hotel, Japa is trying to give the best service at their best rate. I stayed at 1bedroom villa with private pool, which is really a pool where you can stretch up swimming.. inside it has bath tub, seperated shower, double basin, complete amenities (not cheap one), safe deposit box, sleepers, umbrella, kimonos and the most important (for me) is high quality of bed and pillow. The breakfast is limited but.. the taste is 5 star!! And my fave drink is there... sugarcane!!! Till we order more for this drink.. of course.. their hospitality is super... Attentive and fast response."
JAPA Suites & Villas,Your absolute extended family in Bali!,10/01/2021,"I visited Japa with my friends. Other people said, its like home away from home, for us, we felt like we met our extended family in Bali. From pre-arrival until post-departure, Mr. Gilang, Kencana, Basir and other team make us felt special, we felt belong there and they truly understand our needs. The location is just perfect, we can walked easily near Pengosekan and Monkey Forest. The one bedroom pool villa super comfortable and spacious! The pool is perfect for nice evening chill. 24/7 virtual service via WA, that is the best idea ever! For dining experience I can say that Tebu is amazing, not just the set up, the food but also the people, they engage very well with us. And oh, I love their welcome drink ""Yeh Tebu"" and the turn down amenities ""Jaja Satuh"", as a Balinese it's‚Ä¶"

I don‚Äôt remember much of ECONOMICS 101 on account I was daydreaming about the hot biker-babe in the front row, but I think some dude named ADAM SMITH claimed no price is excessive if it clears the market. And considering these rooms were booked solid during my stay it looks like from the ECONOMIC PURISTS‚Äô PERSPECTIVE they aren‚Äôt overpriced. But I‚Äôm not too sure about dodgy economics ‚Äì not called it the DISMAL SCIENCE for nothing.

Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Layanan buruk, tidak bersih, pemandangan indah",05/01/2019,"Sangat sulit tiba di sini karena Anda harus menaiki tangga yang sangat curam dan tidak bisa berkendara di tempat yang dekat. Ruangan yang sangat sederhana dan sangat kotor, dengan pemandangan yang menakjubkan. Bagian terburuknya adalah orang-orang yang bekerja di sini; sangat tidak baik, tidak membantu dan bahkan kasar. Membuat kami merasa sangat tidak diinginkan. Tidak lokasi yang baik untuk apa pun yang lebih lama dari 2 hari tinggal di pendapat saya. Makanan juga tidak baik."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,hanya lokasi,05/01/2019,"satu hal terbaik - pemandangan yang menakjubkan dari teras. Ini adalah pertama kalinya dalam hidup saya bahwa saya hidup di atas lautan. Malam aku bisa mendengar lautan, menyaksikan matahari terbit dan terbenam, itu hanya wow! ! ! ! Berbicara tentang kamar - ya tuhan, nenek saya di desa hidup lebih baik. Tidak ada air panas, kamar mandi kotor dan basah. Bahkan pancuran pun hanya pipa dari tembok. Tempat tidur - baik, saya hal selimut belum pernah dicuci. . . handuk berbau segar, ok. Wi fi bagus. Lanjutkan - mereka perlu sedikit berinvestasi di kamar dan kemudian itu akan menjadi lokasi yang sempurna, tanpa layanan bintang 5 dan kamar, tetapi dengan lokasi yang menakjubkan."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Lebih baik tidak memilih tempat ini,05/01/2019,"Tidak ada jalan ke tempat itu sehingga Anda harus membawa semua barang Anda ke tebing melalui tangga yang licin dan curam selama sekitar 10 menit. Kamar tidak bersih dan tempat tidak terlihat seperti di foto. Perlu pembaruan yang tepat. Kamar mandi juga sangat buruk. Kami memesan tempat melalui Pemesanan sehingga tidak dapat membatalkan tetapi kami memutuskan untuk tidak tidur di tempat ini. Mereka mencoba menawarkan kamar 'lebih baik' dengan AC tapi tetap saja itu sangat buruk. Dan mereka meminta Rp 600.000! ! ! Hanya di atas tebing ada resort yang bagus di mana Anda dapat menginap dengan harga yang sama (kami membayar 250, 000 IDR per malam) dan mendapatkan kamar bersih yang bagus dengan kolam renang."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Pemandangan menakjubkan / di bawah rata-rata kamar dan layanan,05/01/2019,"Tidak ada wi - fi di kamar, tidak ada wi - fi di luar kamar kami juga. Tanpa AC dan kipas tidak berfungsi dengan benar. Toilet flush rusak. Anda pura-pura mandi, tetapi hanya air DINGIN yang keluar dari sesuatu dari dinding. Pasti yang terbaik tentang tempat ini adalah lokasi. Tempat berselancar hanya di depan. Setelah berselancar Anda hanya bisa duduk dan menonton orang lain berselancar selama berjam-jam. Anda dapat menikmati sarapan di bar bawah, untuk harga yang bagus. Harus punya uang tunai di Bingin!"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Menjijikkan,05/01/2019,Tempat terburuk yang pernah ada! Tidak tinggal di sini! Kamar mandi yang menjijikkan dan ada tikus di tempat tidur! ! Ya pemandangannya bagus tapi tidak ada yang lain!
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Staf kasar, tapi pemandangan yang indah",05/01/2019,"Berhati-hatilah jika Anda memesan kamar AC. Ini adalah lokasi terpencil dan sangat dasar, sehingga diharapkan tidak semuanya bekerja dengan sempurna. Saya tidak punya masalah dengan itu, namun, jika AC rusak, Nyoman tidak akan sangat akomodatif, tidak akan menawarkan untuk membiarkan Anda mengganti kamar, dan tidak akan mengganti biaya apa pun. Ini terjadi pada saya, dan ketika saya diminta untuk berganti ke ruang AC (kosong) yang lain, dia berkata tidak, dan sangat pendek dan mudah tersinggung dengan saya. Lalu saya bertanya apakah saya bisa mendapatkan uang kembali, dan dia segera mengatakan kepada saya untuk berkemas dan bertukar kamar, dan sekali lagi sangat kasar dan terburu-buru, mengeluh bahwa saya bahkan menginginkan AC karena ""Bali panas, tidak seperti negara Anda"" .‚Ä¶"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Lokasi bagus dengan layanan yang buruk,05/01/2019,"Ulasan sebelumnya sangat akurat dengan foto dan lokasinya. Tempatnya tenang di pantai yang sepi, dan tampaknya setiap kamar memiliki akses ke balkon dengan pemandangan yang luar biasa. Penukaran makanan terbatas dan Rata-rata, jadi saya tidak mengerti mengapa dia mendapat banyak pujian. Namun, alasan untuk satu bintang adalah layanannya. Mereka tampak baik-baik saja jika tidak ada yang salah, tetapi hari terakhir kami AC rusak. Kami memahami bahwa hal-hal terjadi dan tidak masalah untuk pergi tanpa AC, kecuali fakta bahwa ruangan itu dua kali lipat harga dari yang tanpa AC. Ruang AC yang lain kosong, tetapi mereka menolak untuk membiarkan kami bergerak selama satu malam (dan mulai terlihat marah). Tapi kemudian kami bertanya tentang pengembalian uang untuk selisih biaya ke‚Ä¶"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Nice place for beautiful sunset,05/01/2019,"Lokasi di pantai Bingin, berjalan kaki sekitar 250 m dari parkiran, menuruni banyak tangga dan berkelok kelok.

Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Best Place i've Ever Stayed in Bali,05/01/2019,"I moved to Nyoman & Nyoman after having a terrible experience at Leggies and boy i wished i had stayed here for my full 3 weeks in Bali not just my final 5 nights. Nyoman is the most amazing host, anything you need she can help you with, shes also a very good cook. Maday is a bit cheeky when it comes to the price of certain things like Laundry and transport so also ask Nyoman when it comes to anything to do with negotiable prices. The rooms are super nice. I stayed in the room on the bottom story which had an awesome deck, nice big room and great bathroom. yes the waves can keep you awake on a big tide but you get very used to it and they almost start to put you sleep. Fair to say next time i come to Bali ill be staying here no questions asked."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Accueil,05/01/2019,"Accueil pas tr√®s chaleureux. Chambre tr√®s basique pour le prix.

Les plages sont par contre magnifiques, on en trouve m√™me certaines tr√®s peu fr√©quent√©es."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Loved it,05/01/2019,"We came stayed here for our two nights and absolutely loved it. The beds were very comfortable and rooms stayed cool with just a fan thanks to being tucked into the cliff. Great views, food was fab at the family warung downstairs, the guys running the place where super friendly and attentive. It is basic accomodation but it's perfect, great service, comfy beds, ensuit with flushing toilet and a shower, and a view to die for! We loved it so much we went back for the last two nights of our stay. Cheap and cheerful and great value! Thank you for having us!!"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Lokasi luar biasa, indah host",05/01/2019,"Lokasi adalah benar-benar menakjubkan; jalan yang berliku jalan hutan ke dasar tebing tepat di Pantai Bingin dengan pemandangan ke Dreamlands dan apa yang tidak mungkin di selatan ke utara. Akomodasi ini sangat cocok untuk selancar yang tiada tara. Tuan rumah yang ramah dan ramah orang yang Anda akan bertemu. Makanan baik dan sangat terjangkau. Tidak ada yang terlalu banyak kesulitan, dan semuanya dilakukan dengan senyum besar dan berkata. Tidak tiba mengharapkan resor mewah. Hotel ini sederhana dan terjangkau namun nyaman dan sangat nyaman."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Quelle vue,05/01/2019,"Nous avons pass√© plusieurs journ√©es chez Nyoman. La vue sur Bingin est imprenable. On s'est sentis comme des rois. Les uns allant surfer, les autres promener et se baigner. On y a tr√®s bien mang√©. Les Banana Pacakes, un d√©lice."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Pemandangan yang luar biasa, makanan besar untuk harga yang besar",05/01/2019,"Datang lapar karena porsi yang sangat besar. Kopi Bali sangat fantastis. Saya suka telur dadar, nasi goreng, mie dan teman. Dek adalah tepat di atas ombak."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Pemandangan Yang Bagus, Akomodasi Yang Buruk",05/01/2019,"Tempat ini memiliki pemandangan yang menakjubkan, tapi itu adalah hanya positif. Benar-benar mahal, kamar mandi berbau seperti urin dan ac tidak bekerja. Ketika meminta diskon karena ac tidak bekerja, kami diperlakukan dengan sikap dan menolak kompensasi apapun oleh seorang wanita yang bekerja di sana. Hanya kemudian apakah nyoman datang oleh dirinya sendiri dan meminta maaf dan menawari kami diskon kecil, namun kami harus meminta beberapa kali. Malam yang buruk tidur bergesek dengan tikus di atap."

Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Lokasi yang bagus, akomodasi yang buruk",05/01/2019,"Lokasi yang bagus untuk peselancar yang ingin menyewa papan. 50 000 untuk menyewa papan. Wanita tua yang bekerja di sana sangat membantu jika anda meminta tetapi berbicara sedikit bahasa inggris dan melengking yang banyak. Mereka juga tidak memesan sebuah kamar untuk kami, jadi kami harus mendapatkan lain dan berbagi tempat tidur.

Kami tinggal di pertama di atas dapur namun kami pindah ke salah satu kamar di atas restoran di tahap berikutnya, ada sentuhan lebih mewah - kami berada di bulan madu setelah semua.

Saya punya kamar memesan untuk dua minggu dan di hari ketiga saya, hanya ketika saya datang kembali dari pantai di sekitar 12, wanita (yang saya kira adalah pemilik) mengatakan kepada saya dia telah menyewa kamar saya ke orang lain dan bahwa saya harus meninggalkan dalam waktu dua jam.

Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Amazing stay,08/01/2014,"Recently stayed 4 nights at Nyoman Nyoman with my boyfriend and it was great. We stayed in a basic fan cooled room - the rooms are clean and spacious. Plug sockets on the balcony too which is handy for keeping the cameras charged! the views are breathtaking and it's one of the most chilled out places we've been in bali! Sunsets were incredible. The staff make you feel so welcome, the land lady in particular is lovely. Food was excellent! Highly recommend the squid and rice (ask for the garlic butter sauce). We found the best spot to swim was to the left of the hotel down the steps (less rocks). Would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to get away from the crowds and spend some time in paradise. Be warned- the steps down to the guesthouse are extremely steep !!"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,A home away from home,08/01/2014,"I stayed here for two months and was very comfortable here. Nyoman is such a sweet lady as is Made, her staff. They helped me out with my Bali Kisses!!! Food is fabulous, wifi is decent, and the beds were super comfortable. Definitely recommend this place if you plan to visit Bingin (and Bingin probably has the best vibe on Bali!!!!!!!!)"
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Great food, great value, recommend!",08/01/2014,"We stayed here for a week, the accommodation was a really good price. The room was clean and a good size with amazing views of the sea. Staff all really friendly and helpful. Wifi connection was really good. We ate here most days and the food was always really nice and good value with the restaurant right on the seafront. We never used the board rental but it was good to know that it was available. Bike hire and taxi service arranged from hotel at good prices. Definitely worth the walk down the bingin steps to stay and eat. Will definitely stay again whenever in the area and highly recommend."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Great lunch spot! Worth the walk!,08/01/2014,"Looked at booking this place to stay and had good conversation with owners via email, very responsive. In the end we decided on other accommodations but wanted to make the effort to find this place at least for an amazing meals I read about. As mentioned the food was amazing, and the view overlooking the ocean, priceless. I am glad we did not book for accommodations, not because it was not nice, but is truly suited for people travelling light, or back packing as you have to walk in and down lots of stairs so just be aware as we had suitcases and it would not have been an easy access place for us. Staff so friendly, great place to chill out relax and surf is right there'd as well:)"

Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Amazing views, food, rooms and owners!",08/01/2014,"We stayed at Nyoman & Nyoman for four nights last August. From the beginning you fall in love with the location, having breakfast above the balinese sea or enjoying the sunset with a Bintang. The rooms are clean, with big beds and private bathroom. Also the food is amazing, whether you like indonesian typical food or a burger. The owner and his family are very nice and they made us feel like home. I would definitely recomend his homestay, but most important I would definitely stay again."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Best balinese beach homestay,08/01/2014,"We spent 20 days in Bali and Java traveling and visiting different cities,villages and beaches and from all of the hostels,hotels and homestays we stayed, Nyoman & Nyoman was the best of them all,by far. Its unbeatable location, the wonderful views of the waves, which makes it a perfect surf spot really close to others like uluwatu, and the sunsets are just some of the charms of Nyoman & Nyoman. The food was great, the rooms were clean and the owner and his family,who really took care of us and our wellbeing, made us feel like home. It's a place I would not only just recommend to other tourists to stay in,but also a homestay I would definitly get back to."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,Best chillout spot ever,08/01/2014,"I spent just over 3 months in Bali, Lombok and The Gilis and Nyoman&Nyoman was no doubt my favourite place. So much so that I returned to spend my last week there before leaving for Malaysia. Great atmosphere, amazing waves, great food and the guys working there are totally awesome. Its secluded but only 5-10 minutes from the more busy spots in the area which made it perfect for me. I will be back Nyoman&Nyoman. Oh yes, I will be back Big thanks to Putu, Nyoman, Kat and all the other guys who made this spot so good."
Nyoman & Nyoman Cafe and Accommodation,"Best Value Around Uluwatu, Surfer's Dream Home",08/01/2014,"Great central location around Uluwatu and Padang Padang and as close as you can get to Bingin beach without getting wet. Rooms are clean and cool and view from the balcony outside your room looks out onto the break, walk out your room and 5 minutes later you are out in the lineup. Best value accomodation in Uluwatu, hands down."
The Kirana Agro Resort Tembok Tejakula,Good ambience,10/01/2021,"One of the best hotel to stay at north east of Bali, we can walk direct to the black sand beautiful beach. Humble staff, good ambience, nice garden view. A suitable place for short escape with family Sure will come back again."

Batukaru Coffee Estate,Best place to stay,10/01/2021,"We stayed 2 nights in this incredible üëçüòç jungle lodge. The host Kentri was so generous and extremely welcoming, and the staff were very friendly and professional. All the food was super fresh direct from the land in the estate, fresh clean delicious Indonesian vegetarian food. This place specialises in coffee and it was out of this world, they even have a coffee shop 300 m down the road with stunning rice views. The lodge we stayed in was so beautiful with probably some of the best views in Bali. I cannot recommend this place enough for anyone who wants to explore the real Bali."
Batukaru Coffee Estate,Recharge,09/01/2021,An amazing place the location the staff and the food. You can do as much or as little as you need to recharge your batteries. Kentri and her team are amazing - all the food is prepared from what is grown on the 10 hectare property. Even the building is made from wood from the property. Its worth getting up early for the magical sunrises where on a clear morning you can see the mountains. (Yoga shala is a magnificent spot). And at the end of the day when it gets chilly (and it does) relax by the log fire . Well worth a visit (and return) when you are craving some time with mother nature and some rnr
Batukaru Coffee Estate,Mountain Paradise!,09/01/2021,"We took a group of 10 people to Batukaru Coffee Estate for an active weekend getaway, staying 3 days and 2 nights and by the end we were wishing it was more. Batukaru always feels spiritual and empowering and being up high on her with beautiful views to the Jatiluwih terraces below and beyond to the ocean was incredible. We gave ourselves a full itinerary starting at 545am for Sunrise watch - and certainly it is worth getting up to see, even if the first day was a bit cloudy it was still amazing in a different and moving way, with our 2nd day sunrise being spectacular and breathtaking. The accommodation for us, was amazing, allowing us the communal living and togetherness but still enabling whenever you needed, your own personal space and privacy.The eclectic decoration and‚Ä¶"

Le Cliff Bali,The world changed around me while I stayed still..,09/01/2021,"Absolutely LOVED my stay. Was exactly what I needed... I was in room 2 and it proved to be an absolute sanctuary. I didn't have to go anywhere which was what I really wanted. With the tide high in the morning, and not so great wifi ~ it was the perfect situation to just rest! Loved it when the tide went out, just layed in the shallow water and watched the beautiful scenery. And then back up to my balcony for sunset - it really had it all for me. The bathroom was a little leaky, but that was pretty minor compared to everything the place had to offer. The staff were also super helpful and friendly. Highly recommend and next time I'm staying for 3 nights instead of 2!"
Le Cliff Bali,Just laid back place,09/01/2021,"It was super chilled, breakfast at your room/balcony. Just a lovely hide out and good surf. Great location and nice staff. If you want to relax its a great spot or even watch the pros when surfing. Xxx"

Klapa Resort,Worst experience,09/01/2021,"Worst experience, will never come back!

The Grand Bakas Jungle Retreat Villa,Nice,09/01/2021,"Location : on the border of Gianyar, Ubud separated by a river. Rooms: we had 1 bedroom villa with private pool, jungle view. Villas are big, lush green, similar to ubud vibes but a more quiter and cheaper price. Cleaned enough, if one thing was bothering us, its the old smell of pillows and sheets. Just this and i would give it a higher star. This is an old villa if not, but managed by new management so they did better at maintaining this property. Old reviews were not valid at this point. Car parking was just next to our villa. The staff (Komang) was actually the one who made our stay very nice. Breakfast was Ok."

Staff: friendly and helpful Rooms: Beautiful but a little bit dusty. I had to take my antiseptic wet wipes and wipe down everything in the room. There were cobwebs in the corners of the ceiling. Wish they had mopped the floor too but I don't think they did. I am an OCD and a clean freak so I can tell. The doors, tables and cupboards had some stains and marks on them (not dirty just stains) - they should have spent some time polishing. Views: Amazing ricefield views from the second floor and lovely breeze. Amenities: Great, although I wish there was a desk for working. They only had a low round table.

The room is a nice size with a big, comfortable bed and full-length mirrors. It has two patio sitting areas. The back patio is breathtaking. Nice pool in the back that we had all to ourselves with the rice field as our backdrop. There is a bbq area. Wayan has a fish hatchery. We had the best fish caught from his backyard. The Bayan tree on the way to the river on his property is a great area to do yoga. The river is beautiful and we continued to fish there too for prawns. Next time, we are going tubing on the river!

Lotus Guesthouse,Love it!,10/01/2021,I'm soooo in love with this place.

Bobby's Surf Adventure Resort,Bobby's Surf Camp,06/01/2011,"Surf Camps in Third World countries have their challenges, such as no running water, a porcelien bowl for a toilet, and having to be cautious of malaria carrying mosquitoes, however they also have their charms in that you never have to think of what to cook or eat (you eat what's served), you are at an isolated beach, and you have to be creative with your time if you don't surf. Bobby's Surf Camp in G-Land has become ""wife"" friendly. Our Superior Cottage had air conditioning, sattelite TV, a frig and hot water, so it did not seem we were out in the jungle, at a National Park, where monkeys, monitor lizards and pigs run free. There is so much I could write about my experience, and it was all good, but time does not permit at the moment. The memory remains with me as I'm stuck‚Ä¶"

Bananaleaf Hostel,"Fijne plek, maar service moet echt beter!",10/01/2018,"Bij aankomst waren we erg te spreken over het mooie verblijf. Wij zaten in het hostel, die was erg schoon en netjes met airco. Het was wel bijna het dubbele wat we gewend waren te betalen voor hostels, maar hier had je wel een zwembad bij en een ontbijt erbij in zitten. Het zwembad was mooi en had mooie zitzakken/bedden eromheen. Het ontbijt kan echt beter. Wij moesten meer dan 50 minuten wachten op een simpel ontbijt. Er waren maar 2 personen voor ons die hun ontbijt moesten krijgen. Doordat het zo lang duurde moesten we, naar 2 keer te hebben aangedrongen dat het eten echt moest komen, het eten naar binnen lopen schansen om op tijd te zijn voor de taxi die kwam voor onze duiktrip.

We were made very welcome by the staff who catered to every need and always with a big smile. We look forward to our next stay."

The living quarters are beautiful, the house is in a spectacular location but .... opposite the villa are the loudspeakers of the local village temple. Our 3 weeks booking coincided with a 10 day celebrations clearly marked in the local calendar. Prayers were broadcast day and night for 10 days straight. We love to be exposed to local culture, but I doubt any but deaf westerner would enjoy his stay in Villa Isabella. The owners know exactly what the problem is but would not tell you in advance even if you asked (we did ask if the place was quiet before we made a reservation). This would explain why we‚Ä¶"
